Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed through 
several small incisions. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9931">laparoscope</a>, a small thin tube, is put into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2081">abdomen</a> through a tiny cut made just below the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.comhttps://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm9"> navel</a>. The surgeon can then see the gallbladder on a TV monitor and do the surgery with tools inserted in three other small cuts made in the right upper part of the 
abdomen. The gallbladder is then taken out through one of 
the incisions. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy permits a shorter hospital stay and shorter recovery time with less pain. Possible complications may include bleeding, infection and injury to the bile duct, intestines or major blood vessels.
