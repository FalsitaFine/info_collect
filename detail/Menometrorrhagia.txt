Menometrorrhagia can be a sign of a number of different disorders including hormone imbalance, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endometriosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">endometriosis</a>, benign fibroid tumors in the uterus, and, less commonly, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>. Women who have abnormal menstrual bleeding should always consult their physician to rule out these conditions. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Anemia</a> may result from the excessive uterine bleeding. Treatment depends on the cause. If there does not appear to be a dangerous cause, such as cancer, hormone supplementation, the therapeutic use of birth control pills to better control the menstrual cycle, or fibroid removal (myomectomy) may be recommended. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hysterectomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Hysterectomy</a> may sometimes be required.
