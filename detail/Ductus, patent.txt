Ductus, patent: Failure for the ductus arteriosus, an arterial shunt in fetal life, to close on schedule.  Before birth, blood pumped from the heart through the pulmonary artery toward the lungs is shunted into the aorta. This arterial shunt is a short vessel called the ductus arteriosus. When the  shunt is open, it is said to be patent.   The ductus arteriosus usually closes at or shortly after birth, permitting blood from that moment on to course from the heart directly to the lungs. However, if the ductus arteriosus remains open (patent), flow reverses and blood from the aorta is shunted left-to-right into the pulmonary artery and thence recirculated through the lungs.   A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) may close spontaneously (on its own). If not, it needs to be prompted pharmacologically to close and, if that does not work, it must surgically tied off.
