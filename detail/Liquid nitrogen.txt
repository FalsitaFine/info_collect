Liquid nitrogen: Nitrogen in a liquid state. Liquid nitrogen is supercool -- about 200 degrees Celsius (320 degrees Fahrenheit) below zero -- and is used for cryopreservation, cryosurgery, and cryomedicine. Liquid nitrogen is invaluable for preserving blood and bone marrow cells, sperm, ova, early embryos, and, in the microbiology laboratory, a variety of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, etc). In cryosurgery, a super-chilled scalpel may be used to remove <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> tissue. In dermatology, liquid nitrogen is commonly used to freeze benign growths, precancers, and skin cancers. The liquid nitrogen is usually applied by a spray bottle (canister) or a cotton swab. It is the thawing process that damages the cells. Liquid nitrogen is also known as LN2.
