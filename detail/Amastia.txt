Amastia: A rare condition wherein the normal growth of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm">breast</a> or nipple does not occur.
Unilateral amastia (just on one side) is often associated with absence of the pectoral muscles. Bilateral amastia (with absence of both breasts) is associated in 40% of cases with multiple congenital anomalies (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_defects/article.htm">birth defects</a>) involving other parts of the body as well. 
The condition is thought to be described in the Bible "We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts" (Song of Solomon VIII:8).
Amastia is distinguished from amazia wherein the breast tissue is absent, but the nipple is present.  Amazia typically is a result of radiation or surgery.
