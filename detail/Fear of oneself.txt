Fear of oneself: An irrational fear of oneself, an intense self-fear that is groundless. Fear of oneself is termed "autophobia" which comes from two Greek words: "autos" (self) and "phobos" (fear) = literally, self-fear, fear of oneself. "Autos" has given us many English words such as "automatic" and "automotive" (self-moving) and "autonomy" (self-governing). And "phobos" has bequeathed us a vast number of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/phobias/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">phobias</a> such as "claustrophobia" (fear of closed places) and "acrophobia" (fear of heights).
