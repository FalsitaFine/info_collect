God bless you: Interjection used especially when someone has sneezed. In this situation, "God bless you" is more or less equivalent to saying "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=16120" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Gesundheit</a>."  
In German "Gesundheit" means "health" (and "sanity"). Wishing "good health" was once thought to hold off the illness that might follow a sneeze. 
"God bless you" came into usage to prevent the escape of the soul from the body, which was thought to occur with a sneeze. (Soullessness was believed to cause ill health.)
