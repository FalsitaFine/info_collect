Immunotherapy:  Treatment to stimulate or restore the ability of the immune (defense) system to fight infection and disease. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/biological_therapy/article.htm">Biological therapy</a> is thus any form of treatment that uses the body's natural abilities that constitute the immune system to fight infection and disease or to protect the body from some of the side effects of treatment.
Immunotherapy (also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/biological_therapy/article.htm">biological therapy</a> or biotherapy) often employs substances called biological response modifiers (BRMs). The body normally produces low levels of BRMs in response to infection and disease. Large amounts of BRMs can be made in the laboratory to 
treat cancer, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, and other diseases. 
Forms of biological therapy include monoclonal antibodies, interferon, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and several types of colony-stimulating factors (CSF, GM-CSF, G-CSF). Interleukin-2 and interferon are BRMs being tested for the 
treatment of advanced malignant <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/melanoma/article.htm">melanoma</a>. Interferon is a BRM now in use to treat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_c/article.htm">hepatitis C</a>. 
Biologic therapy to block the action of instruments of 
inflammation called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is being explored to treat conditions such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm">arthritis</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/etanercept/article.htm">Etanercept</a> (ENBREL) is a commercially available injectable TNF-blocking treatment for patients with severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm">rheumatoid arthritis</a>.  
The side effects of biological therapy depend on the type of treatment. Often, these treatments cause flu-like symptoms such as chills, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm">fever</a>, muscle aches, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm">diarrhea</a>. Some patients develop a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm">rash</a>, and some bleed or bruise easily. In addition, interleukin therapy can cause swelling. Depending on how severe these problems are, patients may 
need to stay in the hospital during treatment. These side effects are usually short-term and they gradually go away after treatment stops.
