Carminative: An agent
that prevents or relieves flatulence (gas in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25976" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">gastrointestinal tract</a>) and, in infants, may help in the treatment of colic. The origin of the word "carminative" is particularly curious. It was borrowed from the French carminatif (masc.), carminative (fem.). Virtually all English-language dictionaries state that the French took the word from the Latin carminare, to card wool. However, a respected French dictionary Le Petit Robert indicates that carminare meant nettoyer, to cleanse. The confusion appears to stem from the fact that to card wool was to cleanse it. Thus, a carminative cleanses the bowels.
