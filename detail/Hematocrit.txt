Hematocrit: The proportion of the blood that 
consists of packed <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5260">red blood cells</a>. The hematocrit is expressed as a 
percentage by volume. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5261">red cells</a> are packed by centrifugation. 
For example, an hematocrit of 25% means that there are 25 
milliliters of red blood cells in 100 milliliters of blood. The red cells make up a quarter of the blood.
The normal ranges for the hematocrit are dependant on the age and, after adolescence, the sex of the individual. The normal ranges for the hematocrit are:<ul>
<li>Newborns: 55-68%</li>
<li>One (1) week of age: 47-65%</li>
<li>One (1) month of age: 37-49%</li>
<li>Three (3) months of age: 30-36%</li>
<li>One (1) year of age: 29-41%</li>
<li>Ten (10) years of age: 36-40%</li>
<li>Adult males: 42-54%</li>
<li>Adult women: 38-46%</li></ul>
These values may vary slightly between laboratories.
