Immunization, hepatitis B: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_b/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Hepatitis B</a> (hep B) vaccine
gives prolonged protection, but 3 shots over a half year are usually required. In the
U.S., all infants receive hep B vaccine. Two vaccines (Engerix-B, and Recombivax-HB) are
available in the US. The first dose of hep B vaccine is frequently given while the newborn
is in the hospital or at the first doctor visit following birth. The second dose is given
about 30 days after the initial dose. A booster dose is performed approximately six months
later. Babies born to mothers testing positive for hep B receive, in addition, HBIG (hep B
immune globulin) for prompt protection. Older children (11-12 years) are advised to
receive a hep B booster as are adults in high-risk situations including healthcare
workers, dentists, intimate and household contacts of patients with chronic hep B
infection, male homosexuals, individuals with multiple <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sexual_sex_problems_in_men/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sexual</a> partners, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dialysis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">dialysis</a> patients,
IV drug users, and recipients of repeated transfusions. Health care workers accidentally
exposed to materials infected with hep B (such as needle sticks), and individuals with
known sexual contact with hep B patients are usually given both HBIG and vaccine to
provide immediate and long term protection.
