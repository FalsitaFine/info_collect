Abbreviated HHV-6. There are two forms of HHV-6: A and B. A is rare and is acquired in adulthood. B is relatively common, is usually acquired in childhood, and is associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/roseola/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">roseola</a>. Both HHV-6 A and B can reactivate at a later date and are believed to contribute to diseases of the bone marrow and/or central nervous system in some patients, including fatal encephalitis, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_fatigue_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chronic fatigue syndrome</a>, and possibly <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">multiple sclerosis</a>.
