Antean: Exceptionally strong or large.  After Antaeus, the mythological Greek giant. The son of the earth mother Gaia, Antaeus challenged anyone he encountered to wrestle and always won, since he received strength from his mother, the earth, as long as he was in touch with her. Hercules discovered the secret of Antaeus, lifted him off the ground, and crushed him.
