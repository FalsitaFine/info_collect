Hydrocephalus ex-vacuo: What is termed "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydrocephalus/article.htm">hydrocephalus</a> ex-vacuo" occurs when there is damage to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2516">brain</a> caused by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9791">stroke</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25495">injury</a>, and there may be an actual shrinkage of brain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25243">substance</a>. Although there is more <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7530">CSF</a> than usual, the CSF 
pressure itself is normal in hydrocephalus ex-vacuo.
Hydrocephalus is an abnormal buildup of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7529">cerebrospinal fluid</a> (CSF) in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=26788">ventricles</a> of the brain. The fluid is most often under increased pressure and that pressure can <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2810">compress</a> and damage the brain. 
Hydrocephalus can arise before birth or any time afterward. It may be due to many causes including a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11042">birth defect</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=14263">hemorrhage</a> into the 
brain, infection, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10375">meningitis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5863">tumor</a>, or head injury. Most forms of hydrocephalus are the result of obstructed CSF flow in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=26787">ventricular</a> system. 
With birth defects, physical obstruction of CSF flow in the ventricular system is usually the cause of the hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a common companion of spina 
bifida (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4350">meningomyelocele</a>). 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8477">Normal pressure hydrocephalus</a> (NPH) can occur due to a gradual blockage of the CSF drainage pathways in the brain. Although the ventricles enlarge, the pressure of the CSF remains within <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4582">normal range</a>. NPH is characterized by memory loss (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2940">dementia</a>), balance 
disorder (ataxia), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18377">urinary incontinence</a> and a general slowing of activity.
In old age or persons with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2213">Alzheimer's disease</a>, the entire brain may shrink and the CSF fills up the space created by the shrinkage. This is not due to hydrocephalus. 
The diagnostic signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus depend upon the age of the person:<ul>
<li>In infants the most obvious sign of hydrocephalus is 
usually an abnormally large head. (That is one reason a baby's head should be measured at every well-baby visit). Symptoms of hydrocephalus in an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3966">infant</a> may include 
  vomiting, sleepiness, irritability, an inability to look upwards, and 
  seizures. 
  
<li>In older children and adults there is no head enlargement from hydrocephalus, but symptoms may include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11396">headache</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4510">nausea</a>, vomiting and, sometimes, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=26099">blurred vision</a>. There may be problems with balance, delayed development in walking or talking, and poor coordination.</li>
</li></ul>Irritability, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9879">fatigue</a>, seizures, and personality changes such as an inability to concentrate or remember things may also develop. Drowsiness and double vision are common symptoms as hydrocephalus progresses.
Treatment of hydrocephalus involves the insertion of a 
shunt to let the excess fluid exit and relieve the pressure on the brain. The 
shunt is a flexible, plastic tube with a one-way valve. The shunt is inserted 
into the ventricular system of the brain to divert the flow of CSF into another 
area of the body, where the CSF can drain and be absorbed into the bloodstream.
The prognosis (outlook) with hydrocephalus depends the 
cause and the timing of the diagnosis and treatment. Many children treated for 
hydrocephalus are able to lead normal lives with few, if any, limitations. In 
some cases, cognitive impairments in language and non-language functions may occur. Problems with shunts such as 
infection or malfunction require revision of the shunt.
The word "hydrocephalus" in Greek means "watery head."
