Eye: The organ of sight. The
eye has a number of components. These components include but are not limited to the cornea, 
iris, pupil, lens,
retina, macula, optic nerve, choroid and vitreous.

The cornea is the clear front window of the eye that 
transmits and focuses
light into the eye.
The iris is the colored part of the eye that helps 
regulate the amount of
light that enters the eye.
The pupil is the dark aperture in the iris that 
determines how much light
is let into the eye.
The lens is the transparent structure inside the eye that 
focuses light
rays onto the retina.
The retina is the nerve layer that lines the back of the 
eye, senses light
and creates impulses that travel through the optic nerve to 
the brain.
The macula is a small area in the retina that contains 
special
light-sensitive cells and allows us to see fine details 
clearly.
The optic nerve is the nerve that connects the eye to the 
brain and
carries the impulses formed by the retina to the visual 
cortex of the brain.
The choroid is a thin vascular layer between the sclera and the retina that supplies blood to the retina and conducts arteries and nerves to other structures in the eye.
