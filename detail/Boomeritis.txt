Boomeritis: Injuries to older amateur athletes, especially those who are part of the Baby Boom, born when there was a marked rise in the birthrate following the end of World War II in 1945. As the Baby Boom generation began to turn 40 and 50, there was a veritable explosion of bone and joint aches, pains, injuries, and ailments -- boomeritis. The term was coined by Dr. Nicholas A DiNubile, an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, in 1999.
