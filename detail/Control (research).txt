Control (research): In research, control subjects or control procedures permit
comparison with experimental results. The first controlled clinical research was probably
done in 1875 by the British naval surgeon James Lind who, on board the HMS Salisbury, gave
sailors with scurvy either oranges or lemons or cider or vinegar or nutmeg (or another
treatment) and after just six days discovered that the citrus-consuming sailors had
recovered from scurvy, until then the scourge of extended sea voyages, while the sailors
who had been given the other treatments remained uncured.
