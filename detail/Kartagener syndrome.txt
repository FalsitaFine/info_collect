Kartagener syndrome: A genetic syndrome that is characterized by sinusitis, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bronchiectasis_acquired_congenital/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bronchiectasis</a> (widening and inflammation of the bronchi), dextrocardia (heart on the right side of the chest), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infertility/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">infertility</a>. Kartagener syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Kartagener syndrome is usually due to mutation in the gene called DNAI1 on chromosome 9. However, linkage studies have mapped the disease gene to 5p and 19q in some families, indicating that Kartagener syndrome is more than one genetic entity. Also known as ciliary dyskinesia syndrome.
