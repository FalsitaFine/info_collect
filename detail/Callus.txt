Callus: 1. A localized firm thickening of the upper layer of skin as a result of repetitive friction.  A callus on the skin of the foot has become thick and hard from rubbing (as a result of repetitive friction). Calluses of the feet may lead to other problems such as serious infections. Shoes that fit well can keep calluses from forming on the feet.<br>
2. The hard new bone substance that forms in an 
area of bone fracture. Bony callus is part of the bone repair process.<br>
Also called, less often, a callosity. Both callus and callosity are derived from the Latin callum meaning thick skin.
