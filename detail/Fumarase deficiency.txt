Fumarase deficiency: a rare genetic condition that has only been reported in about 100 people worldwide.  The condition results from a mutation in a gene known as FH that codes for an enzyme called fumarase (also known as fumarate hydratase). Fumarase is involved in chemical reactions in the body that help cells use oxygen and generate energy. Fumarase deficiency often is fatal in infancy, but some people have lived to adulthood.
