Euphenics: A discipline that aims to improve the outcome of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">genetic disease</a> by altering the environment. The term euphenics is from a Greek word meaning 'normal appearing.' For example, people with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/phenylketonuria/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">phenylketonuria</a> (PKU) can avoid the expression of their disease by staying on a low-phenylalanine diet and avoiding major sources of phenylalanine such as diet soft drinks sweetened with aspartame.
