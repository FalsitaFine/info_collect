Micro-RNA: A tiny piece of RNA, about 21 to 23 bases in length, that binds to matching pieces of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4357" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">messenger RNA</a> to make it double-stranded and decrease the production of the corresponding protein. Micro-RNA's were first discovered in the roundworm <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=22180" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">C. elegans </a>in the early 1990s and are now known in many species, including humans. Abbreviated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=22225" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">miRNA</a>.
