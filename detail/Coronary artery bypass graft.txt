Coronary artery bypass graft: Abbreviated CABG. A form of bypass surgery that can create new routes around narrowed and blocked <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7250">coronary arteries</a>, permitting increased blood flow to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_artery_bypass_graft/article.htm">Coronary artery bypass graft</a> is an option for selected groups of patients with significant narrowings and blockages of the heart arteries. The bypass graft for a CABG can be a vein from the leg or an inner chest-wall artery. CABG surgery is one of the most commonly performed major operations. Coronary artery disease develops because of hardening of the arteries (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15018">atherosclerosis</a>) that supply blood to the heart muscle. Diagnostic tests prior to (and after) CABG include the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm">electrocardiogram</a> (EKG), stress test, echocardiogram, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/coronary_angiogram/article.htm">coronary angiography</a>.
