Coronary arteries: The vessels that supply the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9658" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">heart muscle</a> with blood rich
in oxygen. They are called the coronary arteries because they encircle the
heart in the manner of a crown. The word "coronary" comes from the Latin
"corona" and Greek "koron" meaning crown. Like other arteries, the
coronaries may be subject to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2336" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">arteriosclerosis</a> (hardening of the arteries).
There are a number of coronary arteries. Those most often bypassed today
include the right coronary artery, the posterior descending coronary artery,
the left main coronary artery, the left anterior descending coronary artery
and the left <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23419" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">circumflex</a> coronary artery. Plaques obstructing the coronary
arteries may also be treated by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2423" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">balloon angioplasty</a>, stents, and other
