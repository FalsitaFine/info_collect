Dialysis machine: A machine used in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dialysis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">dialysis</a> that filters a patient's blood to remove excess water and waste products when the kidneys are damaged, <br/> dysfunctional, or missing. The dialysis machine itself can be thought of as an artificial kidney. Inside, it consists of more <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">plastic</a> tubing that carries the removed blood to the dialyser, a bundle of hollow fibers that forms a semipermeable membrane for filtering out impurities. In the dialyser, blood is diffused with a saline solution called dialysate, and the dialysate is in turn diffused with blood. When the filtration process is complete, the cleansed blood is returned to the patient. Most patients who undergo dialysis because of kidney impairment or failure use a dialysis machine at a dialysis clinic. Also, a machine called a peritoneal dialysis machine can be used chronically at home for dialysis, which eliminates the need for regular <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemodialysis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">hemodialysis</a> clinic treatments. Using this machine during the day and frequently during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a>, the patient can control his/her own dialysis.
