Nocturnal amblyopia: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amblyopia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Amblyopia</a> refers to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blindness</a> so nocturnal amblyopia is, literally, night blindness. Listed in medical dictionaries under "Nyctalopia" from the Greek nyct (night) + aloas (obscure or blind) + opsis (vision), the condition involves impaired vision in dim light and in the dark due to impaired function of specific vision cells (namely, the rods) in the retina.
Night blindness, a classic finding in vitamin A deficiency, was discovered by the English physician William Heberden (1710-1801). (Heberden also described other medical disorders of importance including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/angina_symptoms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">angina</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chest pain</a> that is often severe and crushing, due to an inadequate supply of oxygen to the heart muscle) and Heberden's nodes, bumps around the small joints due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoarthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">osteoarthritis</a>.) Night blindness (nyctalopia) is also called day sight and nyctanopia.
