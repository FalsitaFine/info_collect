Dust mite: A tiny microscopic organism that is the primary cause of allergies related to house dust. The term "dust mite <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergy</a>" is a misnomer because it is the fecal excretion of these mites to which people are allergic. Dust mites can therefore trigger allergic reactions even when dead.
