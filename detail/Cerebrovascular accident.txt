Cerebrovascular accident:  The sudden death of 
some brain cells due to lack of oxygen when the blood flow to the 
brain is impaired by blockage or rupture of an artery to the brain. A 
CVA is also referred to as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm">stroke</a>. 
<u>Symptoms of a stroke</u> depend on the area of the brain 
affected. The most common symptom is weakness or paralysis of 
one side of the body with partial or complete loss of voluntary 
movement or sensation in a leg or arm. There can be speech problems 
and weak face muscles, causing drooling. Numbness or tingling 
is very common. A stroke involving the base of the brain can affect 
balance, vision, swallowing, breathing and even unconsciousness.
A stroke is a medical emergency. Anyone suspected
of having a stroke should be taken immediately to a medical facility 
for diagnosis and treatment.
The <u>causes of stroke</u>: An artery to the brain may be blocked 
by a clot (thrombosis) which typically occurs in a blood vessel that 
has previously been narrowed due to atherosclerosis ("hardening of 
the artery"). When a blood clot or a piece of an atherosclerotic 
plaque (a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm">cholesterol</a> and calcium deposit on the wall of the artery) 
breaks loose, it can travel through the circulation and lodge in an 
artery of the brain, plugging it up and stopping the flow of blood; 
this is referred to as an embolic stroke. A blood clot can form in a 
chamber of the heart when the heart beats irregularly, as in atrial 
fibrillation; such clots usually stay attached to the inner lining of 
the heart but they may break off, travel through the blood stream, 
form a plug (embolus) in a brain artery and cause a stroke. A 
cerebral hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain), as from an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_aneurysm/article.htm">aneurysm</a> 
(a widening and weakening) of a blood vessel in the brain, also 
causes stroke.
