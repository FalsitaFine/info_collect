Hydrocephalus: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hydrocephalus/article.htm">Hydrocephalus</a> is an abnormal buildup 
of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain. The 
fluid is often under increased pressure and can compress and
damage the brain. 
Hydrocephalus can arise before birth or any time afterward. It may 
be due to many causes including a birth defect, hemorrhage into the 
brain, infection, meningitis, tumor, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/head_injury/article.htm">head injury</a>. Most forms of 
hydrocephalus are the result of obstructed CSF flow in the 
ventricular system. With <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_defects/article.htm">birth defects</a>, physical obstruction of CSF 
flow in the ventricular system is usually the cause of the 
hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a common companion of spina 
bifida (meningomyelocele). 
What is termed "hydrocephalus ex-vacuo" occurs when there is 
damage to the brain caused by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm">stroke</a> or injury, and there may be an 
actual shrinkage of brain substance. "Hydrocephalus ex-vacuo" is 
essentially only hydrocephalus by default; the CSF pressure itself is 
normal.
Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) can also occur due to a 
gradual blockage of the CSF drainage pathways in the brain. Although 
the ventricles enlarge, the pressure of the CSF remains within normal 
range. NPH is characterized by memory loss (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm">dementia</a>), gait disorder, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_incontinence/article.htm"> urinary incontinence</a> and a general slowing of activity.
In old age or persons with Alzheimer's disease, the entire brain 
may shrink and the CSF fills up the space created by the shrinkage. 
This is not due to hydrocephalus. 
The diagnostic signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus depend upon the 
age of the person:<ul>
<li>In infants the most obvious sign of hydrocephalus is 
  usually an abnormally large head. (That is one reason a baby's head should be 
  measured at every well-baby visit). Symptoms of hydrocephalus in an infant may 
  include vomiting, sleepiness, irritability, an inability to look upwards, and 
  seizures. 
  
<li>In older children and adults there is no head enlargement 
from hydrocephalus, but symptoms may include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm">headache</a>, nausea, 
vomiting and, sometimes, blurred vision. There may be problems with 
balance, delayed development in walking or talking, and poor 
coordination.</li>
</li></ul>
Irritability, fatigue, seizures, and personality changes such as an 
inability to concentrate or remember things may also develop. 
Drowsiness and double vision are common symptoms as hydrocephalus 
progresses.
Treatment of hydrocephalus involves the insertion of a shunt to 
let the excess 
fluid exit and relieve the pressure on the brain. The shunt is a 
flexible, plastic tube with a oneway valve. The shunt is inserted 
into the ventricular system of the brain to divert the flow of CSF 
into another area of the body, where the CSF can drain and be 
absorbed into the bloodstream.
The prognosis (outlook) with hydrocephalus depends the cause and 
the timing of the diagnosis and treatment. Many children treated for 
hydrocephalus are able to lead normal lives with few, if any, 
limitations. In some cases, cognitive impairments in language and 
non-language functions may occur. Problems with shunts such as 
infection or malfunction require revision of the shunt.
Hydrocephalus is sometime called "water on the 
brain." The word "hydrocephalus" in Greek literally means "watery 
head."
