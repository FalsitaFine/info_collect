Antithyroid antibody: An antibody directed against the thyroid gland, a gland which produces thyroid hormones (such as, for example, thyroxine and triiodothyronine). Antithyroid antibodies can be associated with inflammation of the thyroid gland and affect its function. Antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies are examples of antithyroid antibodies.
