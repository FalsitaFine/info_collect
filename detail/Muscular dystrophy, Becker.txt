Muscular dystrophy, Becker: A form of muscular dystrophy (MD) that is similar to Duchenne MD but milder. Patients with Becker MD produce a little of the key protein, dystrophin, whereas those with Duchenne make none. Progression of Becker MD is slower and symptoms tend to appear later than progression of Duchenne MD. Both Becker and Duchenne MD result from mutations in the gene on the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6030" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">X chromosome</a> that encodes dystrophin.
