Concatenate: To link together in a chain or in a series. For example, the lymph nodes that appeared enlarged were concatenated, in a row like the links of a chain.

The word "concatenate" comes from the Latin "concatenare"
which was formed from "com-" meaning "with or together" and "catena" meaning "chain." (The word "chain" itself comes from the same root -- "catena.")
