Intermittent insomnia may not require treatment since the episodes of insomnia usually only last a few days at a time. For example, if insomnia is due to a temporary change in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a>/wake schedule, as with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/jet_lag/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">jet lag</a>, the biological clock will often get back to normal on its own.
