DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid. One of two types of molecules 
that encode <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3573">genetic</a> information. (The other is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5382">RNA</a>. In humans DNA is the genetic material; RNA is transcribed from it. In some other organisms, RNA is the genetic material and, in reverse fashion, the DNA is transcribed from it.)  
DNA is a double-stranded <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4418">molecule</a> held together by weak <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=26767">hydrogen</a> bonds between base pairs of nucleotides. The molecule forms a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3109">double helix</a> in 
which two strands of DNA spiral about one other. The double helix looks 
something like an immensely long ladder twisted into a helix, or coil. The sides 
of the "ladder" are formed by a backbone of sugar and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.comhttps://www.medicinenet.com/strep_throat_gas/article.htm9">phosphate</a> molecules, and the "rungs" consist of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4596">nucleotide</a> bases joined weakly in the middle by the hydrogen bonds.  
There are four nucleotides in DNA. Each nucleotide 
contains a base: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2143">adenine</a> (A), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3639">guanine</a> (G), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2908">cytosine</a> (C), or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5774">thymine</a> 
(T). Base pairs form naturally only between A and T and between G and 
C so the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2441">base sequence</a> of each single strand of DNA can be simply 
deduced from that of its partner strand. 
The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3574">genetic code</a> in 
DNA is in triplets such as ATG. The base sequence of that triplet in the partner strand is 
therefore TAC. 
The first proof that DNA was the hereditary material was 
provided in 1944 by Oswald Avery, Maclyn McCarty and Colin MacLoed. The double 
helical structure of DNA was discovered in 1953 by James D. Watson and Francis 
H.C. Crick with the invaluable 
collaboration of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6032">X-ray</a> crystallographer Rosalind 
Franklin. Watson and Crick shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with 
Maurice H.F. Wilkins.
