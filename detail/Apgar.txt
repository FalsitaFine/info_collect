Apgar: Abbreviation for the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/apgar_score/article.htm">Apgar score</a>, a practical method 
of evaluating the physical condition of a newborn 
infant shortly after delivery. The Apgar score is a number arrived at by scoring the heart 
rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, skin color, and response to a 
catheter in the nostril. Each of these objective signs can
receive 0, 1, or 2 points. 
A perfect Apgar score of 10 means an infant is in the best possible
condition. An infant with an Apgar score of 0-3 needs immediate 
resuscitation. 
The Apgar score is done routinely 60 seconds after the birth of 
the infant and then it is commonly repeated 5 minutes after birth. In 
the event of a difficult resuscitation, the Apgar score may 
be done again at 10, 15, and 20 minutes. 
An Apgar score of 0-3 at 20 minutes of age is predictive of high 
morbidity (disease) and mortality (death). 
The score is named for the preeminent American anesthesiologist 
Virginia Apgar (1909-1974) who invented the scoring method in 1952. 
Having assisted at thousands of deliveries, Dr. Apgar wished to focus 
attention on the baby. Babies were traditionally dispatched directly 
to the nursery, often without much formal scrutiny after delivery. 
Apgar wanted the baby to be assessed in an organized meaningful 
manner by the delivery room personnel. Dr. Apgar was the first woman 
to be appointed a full professor at Columbia University's College of 
Physicians and Surgeons.
