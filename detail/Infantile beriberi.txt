Infantile beriberi: Disease in infants due to deficiency of thiamine. This disease is well-known in undeveloped countries among malnourished infants  but it is very rare in developed countries. It can occur if a breastfeeding mother has an inadequate intake of thiamine. The disease can also occur in infants who are fed a formula containing insufficient thiamine, as happened tragically in 2003 in Israel. The culprit was Remedia Super Soya 1, a kosher, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/soy_glycine_soya-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">soy</a>-based, dairy-free baby formula used mainly by ultraorthodox Jewish families. The formula by error had inadequate thiamine. Its use left at least 2 two children dead and 15 suffering from possible brain damage. Thiamine is also known as vitamin B1.
