Deficiency, long-chain-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase: Acute <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatty_liver/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatty liver</a> of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a> (AFLP) has been found to be associated in some cases with an abnormality of fatty-acid metabolism. This abnormality is a deficiency of the enzyme long-chain-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD).
The mother (and father) have 50% of normal LCHAD activity and the fetus has no LCHAD activity. The metabolic disease in the baby's liver apparently causes the fatty <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver disease</a> in the mother. In cases of AFLP due to LCHAD deficiency, there is a 25% (or greater) risk of AFLP in each pregnancy.
