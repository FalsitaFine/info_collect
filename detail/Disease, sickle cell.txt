Disease, sickle cell: A genetic blood disorder caused by the presence 
of an abnormal form of hemoglobin. These hemoglobin molecules tend to aggregate 
after unloading oxygen forming long, rod-like strictures that force the red 
cells to assume a sickle shape. Unlike normal red cells, which are usually 
smooth and malleable, the sickle red cells cannot squeeze through small blood 
vessels. When the sickle cells block small blood vessels, the organs are 
deprived of blood and oxygen. This leads to periodic episodes of pain and 
damages the vital organs. Sickle red cells die after only about 10 to 20 days. 
Instead of the usual 120 days or so. Because they cannot be replaced fast 
enough, the blood is chronically short of red cells, causing 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sickle_cell/article.htm">anemia</a>. The gene 
for sickle cell anemia must be inherited from both parents for the illness to 
occur in children. A child with only one copy of the gene may have sickle-cell 
traits but no symptoms of illness.
