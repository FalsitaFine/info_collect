Epithelium: The outside layer of cells that covers all
the free, open surfaces of the body including the skin, and mucous membranes that
communicate with the outside of the body. By contrast the endothelium is the layer of
cells lining the closed internal spaces of the body such as the blood vessels and
lymphatic vessels (that convey the lymph, a milky fluid).
