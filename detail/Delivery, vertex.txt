Delivery, vertex: In a vertex delivery, the top of the baby's
head comes first. The vertex here refers to the top of the head. The word
"vertex" in Latin means a "whirlpool, whirlwind, top of the mountain, or
the top of the head." Why "top of the head"? Because the hairs on the top
of the head often form a whorl, a whirl-like pattern.
