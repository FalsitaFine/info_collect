Hemorrhage, subarachnoid: Bleeding within the head into the space between two membranes that surround the brain. The bleeding is beneath the arachnoid membrane and just above the pia mater. (The arachnoid is the middle of three membranes around the brain while the pia mater is the innermost one.) 
The subarachnoid space is a potential space. It is normally filled with cerebrospinal fluid. With a subarachnoid bleed, the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space is bloody.
