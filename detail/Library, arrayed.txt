Library, arrayed: In genetics, arrayed libraries of DNA
clones are used for many purposes, including screening for a specific gene or genomic
region of interest as well as for physical mapping. An arrayed library consists of (in
technical terms) individual primary recombinant clones (which are hosted in phage, cosmid,
YAC, or another vector) that have been placed in two-dimensional arrays in microtiter
dishes (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">plastic</a> dishes with an orderly array of tiny wells). Each primary clone can be
identified by the identity of the plate and the clone location (row and column) on that
plate. The information gathered on individual clones from various genetic linkage and
physical map analyses is then entered into a relational database and used to construct
physical and genetic linkage maps.
