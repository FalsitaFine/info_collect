Cancer, ovary: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ovarian_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Ovarian cancer</a> begins in the ovaries, the female reproductive organs that produce eggs.  The anatomic location of the ovaries is within the pelvis next to the fallopian tubes which are connected to the uterus or womb.   Most ovarian growths (tumors) in women under age 30 are benign, fluid-filled <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cyst/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cysts</a>. These cysts are not cancerous. Ovarian cancers are more common in women as women age.  There are several types of ovarian <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>. Symptoms of ovarian cancer can be vague causing problems with early detection. Detection of ovarian cancer involves physical examination (including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pelvic_exam/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">pelvic exam</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ultrasound</a>, x-ray tests, CA-125 blood test and biopsy of the ovary.  Treatment involves surgery and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chemotherapy</a>, and occasionally radiation treatment. Modern chemotherapy can extend life even when the cancer is found spread or in advanced stage.<!--START IMAGETAG--> <div id="lrgArtImg"> <div itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"> <img alt="Female Illustration - Cancer, ovary" itemprop="image" src="https://images.medicinenet.com/images/illustrations/female_structures.jpg"> </img></div> </div> <!--END IMAGETAG-->
