Ecstasy: 1. A state of rapture and trancelike elation.<br>
2. A street name for 3-4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), best known on the street as "Ecstacy." An illicit drug, considered a recreational or party drug. It acts as both a stimulant and a hallucinogen. Ecstasy achieves its high by preventing the brain from reabsorbing the chemical serotonin, thereby prolonging its effects in the body.
