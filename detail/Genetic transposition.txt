Genetic transposition: The ability of genes to change position on chromosomes, a process in which a transposable element is removed from one site and inserted into a second site in the DNA. Genetic transposition was the first type of genetic instability to be discovered.   This remarkable phenomenon was discovered by the great American geneticist <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=26146" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Barbara McClintock</a> (1902-1992) who won the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for her discovery of mobile genetic elements." McClintock did her pioneering research in a plant (maize) decades earlier, at a time when the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3574" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">genetic code</a> and the structure of the DNA <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3109" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">double helix</a> were not yet known. This type of element has now been found in microorganisms, insects, animals and man and has been demonstrated to have important functions.
