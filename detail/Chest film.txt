Chest film: Most common X-ray used to detect
abnormalities in or within the thoracic cage, such as the lungs, heart, aorta, and the
bones of the chest. Extra metallic objects, such as jewelry are removed from the chest and
neck areas for a chest x-ray to avoid interference with x-ray penetration and improve
accuracy of the interpretation.
