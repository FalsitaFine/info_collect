Day sight:  Night blindness. 
Listed in medical dictionaries under "Nyctalopia" from the 
Greek "nyct' (night) + "aloas" (obscure or blind) + "opsis" 
(vision), the condition involves impaired vision in dim 
light and in the dark (but normal sight in bright light), 
due to impaired function of specific vision cells (the 
"rods") in the retina. Day sight (night blindness) is a 
classic symptom resulting from deficiency of vitamin A. It 
was discovered by the English physician William Heberden 
(1710-1801) who described other medical disorders of 
importance including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/angina_symptoms/article.htm">angina</a> pectoris (chest pain that is 
often severe and crushing, due to an inadequate supply of 
oxygen to the heart muscle) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoarthritis/article.htm">osteoarthritis</a> of the small 
joints with nodules (Heberden's nodes) in and about the 
last joint of the finger.  Day sight (night blindness) is 
also called nocturnal amblyopia and nyctanopia.
