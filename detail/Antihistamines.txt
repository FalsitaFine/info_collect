Antihistamines: Drugs that combat the histamine
released during an allergic reaction by blocking the action of the histamine on the
tissue. Antihistamines do not stop the formation of histamine nor do they stop the
conflict between the IgE and antigen. Therefore, antihistamines do not stop the allergic
reaction but protect tissues from some of its effects. Antihistamines frequently cause
mouth dryness and sleepiness. Newer non-sedating antihistamines are generally
thought to be somewhat less effective. Antihistamine side effects that very occasionally
occur include urine retention in males and fast heart rate.
