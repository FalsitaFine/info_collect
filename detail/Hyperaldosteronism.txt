Hyperaldosteronism: Overproduction of the hormone aldosterone from the
outer portion (cortex) of the adrenal gland or a tumor containing that type of tissue.
Excess aldosterone (pronounced al-do-ster-one) results in low potassium levels
(hypokalemia), underacidity of the body (alkalosis), muscle weakness, excess thirst
(polydipsia), excess urination (polyuria), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm">high blood pressure</a> (hypertension). Also
called aldosteronism and Conn's syndrome.
