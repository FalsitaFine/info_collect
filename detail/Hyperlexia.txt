Hyperlexia: The presence of advanced ability to read compared to the ability to understand spoken language.   Children with hyperlexia have a precocious ability to read words, far above what would be expected at their chronological age or an intense fascination with letters or numbers; significant difficulty in understanding verbal language; and abnormal social skills, difficulty in socializing and interacting appropriately with people.  Hyperlexia, according to some experts, may belong in the autistic spectrum along with autism and Asperger syndrome.
