Migraine headache: The most common type of vascular headache involving abnormal sensitivity of arteries in
the brain to various triggers resulting in rapid changes in the 
artery size due to spasm (constriction). Other arteries in the brain and scalp then open (dilate), and throbbing pain is perceived in the head. The tendency to migraine is inherited and appears to
involve serotonin, a chemical in the brain involved in the 
transmission of nerve impulses that trigger the release of substances in the blood vessels that in turn cause the pain of
the migraine. These nerve impulses cause the flashing lights and 
other sensory phenomena known as an aura that may accompany a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine/article.htm">migraine</a>. Not all severe headaches are migraines and not all migraines are severe.

Factors known to make migraines worse 
in some patients include stress, food sensitivities, menstruation, 
and the onset of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm">menopause</a>. Most patients will feel better if they lie down and avoid bright lights. Prevention measures can include taking preventative medication (usually an antispasmodic) and 
avoiding any known migraine triggers. Medication is also available 
that can ease the pain of a current migraine.
