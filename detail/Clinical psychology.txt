Clinical psychology: A professional specialty concerned with diagnosing and treating diseases of the brain, emotional disturbance, and behavior problems. 
Psychologists can only use talk therapy as treatment; you must see a psychiatrist or other medical doctor to be 
treated with medication. Psychologists may have a master's degree (MA) or doctorate (PhD) in psychology. They may also have other qualifications, including Board certification and additional training in a type of therapy.
