Acute idiopathic polyneuritis: Also known as the Guillain-Barre syndrome, a disorder characterized by progressive symmetrical paralysis and loss of reflexes, usually beginning in the leg, with in most cases nearly complete or complete recovery.
The Guillain-Barre syndrome is not associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm">fever</a>. There is paralysis involving more than one limb, most commonly the legs, and that paralysis is progressive. There is areflexia (loss of reflexes) or hyporeflexia (diminution of reflexes) in the legs and arms. Other conditions that may mimic the Guillain-Barre syndrome need to be ruled out. 
The Guillain-Barre syndrome is due to an immune response that results in the direct destruction of the myelin sheath surrounding the peripheral nerves or the axon of the nerve itself.
The syndrome sometimes follow triggering events, including vaccinations. Among the vaccines reportedly associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome are the swine <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm">influenza</a> vaccine (in 1976-1977), the oral poliovirus vaccine, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tetanus/article.htm">tetanus</a> toxoid. Aside from vaccinations, infection with the bacteria Campylobacter jejuni and viral infections can trigger the Guillain-Barre syndrome.
