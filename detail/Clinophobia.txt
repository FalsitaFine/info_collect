Clinophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of going to bed. Sufferers from clinophobia experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a> even though they realize that going to bed normally should not threaten their well-being. However, because they worry about having <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nightmares/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nightmares</a> or wetting the bed, they often remain awake and develop <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insomnia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">insomnia</a>. Insomnia then can become a real threat to their well-being.
"Clinophobia" is derived from the Greek "klinein" (to bend, slope or incline, as one does during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a>) and "phobos" (fear). Another medical term containing "clino-"is "clinodactyly" meaning a finger that is curved to the side.
