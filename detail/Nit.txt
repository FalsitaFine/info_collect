Nit: Nits are lice eggs. They are hard to see and are often confused with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seborrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dandruff</a> or hair spray droplets. Nits are found firmly attached to the hair shaft. They are oval and usually yellow to white. Nits take about a week to hatch. All nits must be removed to prevent reinfestation with lice. They can be removed with a special comb or with the fingers. Topical preparations are available that loosen the "glue" that binds them to the hair, making removal easier.
