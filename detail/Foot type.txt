Foot type: The category into which a particular foot falls. Foot types are generally classified into one of three categories: pronator, neutral, or supinator. 
The pronator type of foot rolls far inward during the weight-bearing phase of the stride. This foot type is characterized by a very low or flat arch. Heavier people often have feet in this category.

The supinator type of foot restricts the impact of the stride largely to the outer edges of the foot. This is often due to a very high, rigid arch.

The neutral type of foot is between the pronator and supinator types. It is the most common foot type. Runners with a neutral type of foot lands on the
heel and rolls forward during the gait cycle until the impact is distributed evenly across the forefoot.
