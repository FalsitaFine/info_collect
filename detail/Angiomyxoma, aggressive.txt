Angiomyxoma, aggressive: A slow-growing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> of stromal cells which occurs primarily in the genital and pelvic regions. This tumor is much more common in women. It can range from relatively small tumors to football-size masses in the pelvis. The histologic appearance of the tumor under the microscope is rather distinctive. Treatment consists of surgical excision (removal). Unfortunately, there is a relatively high rate of recurrence because the exact extent of the tumor is difficult for the surgeon to determine. These tumors appear not to have the ability to metastasize (spread to distant organs).
