EOS: The gene for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33432" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">familial eosinophilia</a>. EOS has been mapped to chromosome region 5q31-33 containing the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11937" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cytokine</a> gene cluster which includes the genes for interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-5 (IL-5), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=31266" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">granulocyte colony-stimulating factor</a> (G-CSF),  and all of which are thought play roles in the development, proliferation, and activation of eosinophils.
