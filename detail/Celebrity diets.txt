Celebrity diets: Celebrity diets are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a> plans that are reportedly endorsed by or used by celebrities. There are many different variations of celebrity diets, but most involve severe restriction of carbohydrates and/or calories. Other celebrity diets may involve gimmicks, such as the consumption of specially-formulated drinks or specific combinations of food. None of the celebrity diets has been recommended by medical professionals as a weight loss plan, and these are not considered a healthy way to lose weight.
