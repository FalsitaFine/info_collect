Leg: In popular usage, the part of the body from the top of the thigh down to the foot, and in medical terminology, the portion of the lower extremity that runs from the knee to the ankle. The leg (in the medical sense) has two bones'the tibia (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8460" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">shinbone</a>) and the fibula'both of which are known as long bones. The larger of the two is the tibia. The fibula runs alongside the tibia.
