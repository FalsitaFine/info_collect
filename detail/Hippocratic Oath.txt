Hippocratic Oath: One of the oldest binding documents in history, the Oath written by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=20908">Hippocrates</a> is still held sacred by physicians: to treat the ill to the best of one's ability, to preserve a patient's privacy, to teach the secrets of medicine to the next generation, and so on. 

There are many versions of the Hippocratic Oath. 
We here present two versions. First, the "classic" version (or more precisely, one translation of the original oath). And then, following it, is presented one of the fine "modern" versions of the Hippocratic Oath.
