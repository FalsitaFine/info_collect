Niemann-Pick disease type C: Abbreviated NPC. A type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10149">Niemann-Pick disease</a> inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, resulting in lipid storage in the brain and body. At the cellular level, the disorder is characterized by the accumulation of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2710">cholesterol</a> and glycolipid. Most (about 95%) of NPC patients have mutations in the NPC1 gene in chromosome 18q11 which encodes a large <a href="https://www.medicinenet.comhttps://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis/article.htm4">membrane</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=16842">glycoprotein</a>. The rest (about 5%) of NPC patients have mutations in the NPC2 gene in chromosome 14q24.3 which encodes a small cholesterol-binding protein. The identical <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15510">biochemical</a> patterns observed in NPC1 and NPC2 mutants suggest that the two NPC proteins function in a coordinate fashion in the cellular transport of cholesterol, glycolipids and other cargo.
