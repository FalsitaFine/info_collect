Infant, postmature: A baby born 2 weeks (14 days) or more after the usual 9 months (280 days) of gestation. The gestation (length of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a>) is calculated from the date of the last menstrual period (LMP). This is an important calculation since, if delivery is delayed 3 weeks beyond term, the infant mortality rate skyrockets to 3 times normal. 
The definition of a postmature infant has evolved. A few sources still consider a baby postmature if it is born a week after the usual 9 months' gestation but the current trend is to consider a baby postmature ONLY if it is born 2 weeks (14 days) or more after the usual 9 months of gestation.

The terms "postmature infant" and "post-term infant" are interchangeable.
