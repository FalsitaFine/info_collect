Amini, Fariborz: Iranian-born American psychiatrist (1930-2004), at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), known for using <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=13754" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">science</a> to study the phenomenon of love. In his work, Amini explained "how lingering but forgotten impressions, like a smell or sound associated with a person or a positive experience, become embedded in the mind's memory banks, where neurons constantly fire and forge connections. Over time these links are reinforced through repeated exposure, leading to affectional bonds." This thesis was set forth in "A General Theory of Love" (2000)  which Amini published in 2000 with his UCSF colleagues Thomas Lewis and Richard Lannon.  He was also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33853" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Fari Amini</a>.
