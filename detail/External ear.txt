External ear: There are three sections of the ear. They are 
the external
ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. The external ear 
looks complicated
but it is functionally the simplest part of the ear. It 
consists of the
pinna or auricle (the visible projecting portion of the 
ear), the external
acoustic meatus (the outside opening to the ear canal), and 
the external ear
canal that leads to the ear drum. In sum, there is the 
pinna, the meatus and
the canal. And the external ear has only to concentrate air 
vibrations on
the ear drum and make the drum vibrate. The external ear is 
also called the
outer ear.
