Aortic valve, bicuspid:   Whereas 
the normal aortic valve in the heart has three flaps 
(cusps) that open and close, a bicuspid valve has only two. 
There may be no symptoms in childhood, but in time the 
valve may become stenotic (narrowed), making it harder for 
blood to pass through it, or the valve may start to let 
blood leak backwards through the valve (regurgitate). 
Treatment depends on how the valve is working and overall 
condition of the affected individual.
