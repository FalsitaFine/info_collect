Library: In genetics, a library is an unordered
collection of clones (i.e., cloned DNA from a particular organism), 
whose relationship to
each other can be established by physical mapping. For example, you 
can have an E. coli
library or a human DNA library. Among the types of libraries, there 
are genomic libraries
and arrayed libraries.
