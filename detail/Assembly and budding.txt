Assembly and budding: A portion of the processes by which new HIV is formed in infected host cells. Viral core proteins, enzymes, and RNA gather (assemble) just inside the cell's membrane, while the viral envelope proteins aggregate within the membrane. An immature <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23863" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">viral particle</a> is formed and then pinches off (buds) from the cell, acquiring an envelope and the cellular and HIV proteins from the cell membrane. The immature viral particle then undergoes processing by an HIV enzyme called protease to become an infectious virus.
