Colonic (noun): Colonic irrigation, the infusion of liquid into the colon through a tube in the rectum.     It is claimed that colonics "detoxify" and "cleanse" the body and have other health benefits. There is no convincing scientific evidence to support these claims and in some cases may even do harm (cause ulcers or make a hole)
