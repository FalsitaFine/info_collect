Lenin: (1870-1924) Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the founder of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state. Lenin is of some medical interest because he has been retrospectively diagnosed with syphilis. Lenin may have contracted the disease in Europe years before he led the October Revolution in 1917 and the disease followed an erratic but progressively debilitating course to his death in 1924 at age 53.
