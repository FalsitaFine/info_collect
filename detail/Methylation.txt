Methylation: 1. In chemistry, the addition of a methyl group to a molecule. 2. On a protein level, the addition of a methyl group or groups to the amino acid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7006" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">arginine</a> or lysine in a protein. 3. On a DNA level, the addition of a methyl group to a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2908" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cytosine</a> residue to convert it to 5-methylcytosine. Methylation of DNA occurs at <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=26443" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">CpG</a> sites, where cytosine (C) lies next to guanine (G). The CpG sites are in regions near the promoters of a genes. These regions are known as CpG islands. The state of methylation of CpG islands is critical to both gene activity and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3564" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">gene expression</a>.
