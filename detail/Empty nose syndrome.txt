Empty nose syndrome: a term that was coined in 1994 to refer to patients who have had surgery to remove all or part of the nasal turbinates (structures that attach to the side wall of those nose and filter and humidify the air). The affected patients are said to experience severe nasal dryness and crusting, as well as a feeling of obstruction in the nasal passages. The existence of this syndrome has remained controversial, however, because many patients experience significant relief after turbinate surgery.
