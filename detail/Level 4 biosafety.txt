Level 4 biosafety: The highest level of biosafety. This level is used for the diagnosis of exotic agents such as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6518" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Ebola virus</a> that pose a high risk of life-threatening disease, which may be transmitted by the aerosol route and for which there is no vaccine or therapy.
A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=14880" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">biosafety level</a> is a specific combination of work practices, safety equipment, and facilities which are designed to minimize the exposure of workers and the environment to infectious agents. The 4 standard biosafety levels are:  <ul>
<li>Level 1 -- This level applies to agents that do not ordinarily cause human disease. <li>Level 2 -- This level is appropriate for agents that can cause human disease, but whose potential for transmission is limited. <li>Level 3 -- This level applies to agents that may be transmitted by the respiratory route which can cause serious infection. <li>Level 4 -- This level is used for the diagnosis of   exotic agents that pose a high risk of life-threatening disease, which may be   transmitted by the aerosol route and for which there is no vaccine or   therapy.</li> </li></li></li></ul>
