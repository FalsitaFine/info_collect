Examples of NSAIDs include aspirin, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/indomethacin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">indomethacin</a> (brand name: Indocin), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ibuprofen</a> (brand name: Motrin), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/naproxen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">naproxen</a> (brand name: Naprosyn), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/piroxicam/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">piroxicam</a> (brand name: Feldene), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nabumetone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">nabumetone</a> (brand name: Relafen).
