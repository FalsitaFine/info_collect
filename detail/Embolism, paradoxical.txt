Embolism, paradoxical: Passage of a clot (thrombus) from a vein to an
artery. When clots in veins break off (embolize) , they travel first to the right side of
the heart and, normally, then to the lungs where they lodge. The lungs act as a filter to
prevent the clots from entering the arterial circulation. However, when there is a hole in
the wall between the two upper chambers of the heart (an atrial septal defect), a clot can
cross from the right to the left side of the heart, then pass into the arteries as a
paradoxical embolism. Once in the arterial circulation, a clot can travel to the brain,
block a vessel there, and cause a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm">stroke</a> (cerebrovascular accident). Because of the risk
of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm">stroke</a> from paradoxical embolism, it is usually recommended that even small atrial
septal defects be repaired. Also called crossed embolism.
