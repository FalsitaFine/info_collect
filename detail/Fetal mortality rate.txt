Fetal mortality rate: The ratio of fetal deaths 
divided
by the sum of the births (the live births + the fetal deaths) in that 
year. In the United
States, the fetal mortality rate plummeted from 19.2 per 1,000 births 
in 1950 to 9.2 per
1,000 births in 1980. However, the fetal mortality rate is higher in 
certain ethnic groups and among mothers with health problems during 
pregnancy, especially if the mother does not receive adequate 
personal and prenatal health care. The fetal mortality rate is 
considered a good measure of the quality of health care in a country 
or a medical facility.
