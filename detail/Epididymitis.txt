Epididymitis: Inflammation of the epididymis. Epididymitis can be caused by sexually acquired bacteria, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia; or by bacteria that come from somewhere else, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli__0157h7/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">E. coli </a>from the bowel. Sometimes no bacteria are found to be associated. Bacterial epididymitis is treated with antibiotics. If no bacterial cause is detected, medications to reduce inflammation are sometimes helpful.
