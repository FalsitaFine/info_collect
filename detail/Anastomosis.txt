Anastomosis: The connection of normally separate parts. An anastomosis may be naturally occurring or it may be created during embryonic development, surgery, or trauma, or by pathological means. An anastomosis may, for example, connect two blood vessels, or it may connect the healthy sections of the colon or rectum after a cancerous or otherwise diseased portion has been surgically removed.
