Mendel, Gregor: The father of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15390" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">genetics</a>, the Moravian/Bohemian biologist who in the 19th century set forth the basic laws that constitute the foundation of classical genetics. Mendel's controlled experiments with breeding peas in the monastery garden led him to conclude that the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3719" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">heritable</a> units (now called genes) were not blends of parental traits, but rather were separate physical entities passed individually from one generation to the next.
