APLS (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome): An immune disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal antibodies in the blood  associated with abnormal blood clotting, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">migraine</a> headaches, recurrent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a> losses (repeat spontaneous abortions), and low blood platelet counts (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thrombocytopenia_low_platelet_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">thrombocytopenia</a>). The abnormal antibodies are directed against phospholipids, fats that contains phosphorous. APLS can occur by itself (primary APLS) or be caused by another underlying condition (secondary APLS). About a third of persons with primary APLS have heart valve abnormalities.
Antiphospholipid antibodies reduce the levels of annexin V, a protein that binds phospholipids and has potent anticoagulant activity. The reduction of annexin V levels is thought to be a possible mechanism underlying the increased tendency of blood to clot and the propensity to pregnancy loss characteristic of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
