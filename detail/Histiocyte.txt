Histiocyte: A type of white blood cell, also 
called a macrophage, that is created by the bone marrow. 
They usually stay in place, but when histiocytes are 
stimulated by infection or inflammation they become active, 
attacking bacteria and other foreign matter in the body. 
See also histiocytosis.
