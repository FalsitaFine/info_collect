Anemia, Mediterranean: Better known today as
thalassemia (or as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/beta_thalassemia/article.htm">beta thalassemia</a> or thalassemia major). The clinical picture of this
important type of anemia was first described in 1925 by the pediatrician Thomas Benton
Cooley. The name thalassemia was coined by the Nobel Prize winning pathologist George
Whipple and the professor of pediatrics Wm Bradford at U. of Rochester because thalassa in
Greek means the sea (like the Mediterranean Sea) + -emia means in the blood so
thalassemia means sea in the blood. Thalassemia is not just one disease. It is a complex
contingent of genetic (inherited) disorders all of which involve underproduction of
hemoglobin, the indispensable molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The globin
part of normal adult hemoglobin is made up of 2 alpha and 2 beta polypeptide chains. In
beta thalassemia, there is a mutation (change) in both beta globin chains leading to
underproduction (or absence) of beta chains, underproduction of hemoglobin, and profound
anemia. The gene for beta thalassemia is relatively frequent in people of Mediterranean
origin (for example, from Italy and Greece). Children with this disease inherit one gene
for it from each parent. The parents are carriers (heterozygotes) with just one
thalassemia gene, are said to have thalassemia minor, and are essentially normal. Their
children affected with beta thalassemia seem entirely normal at birth because at birth we
still have predominantly fetal hemoglobin which does not contain beta chains. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm">anemia</a>
surfaces in the first few months after birth and becomes progressively more severe leading
to pallor and easy fatigability, failure to thrive (grow), bouts of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm">fever</a> (due to
infections) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm">diarrhea</a>. Treatment based on blood transfusions is helpful but not
curative. Gene therapy will, it is hoped, be applicable to this disease.
