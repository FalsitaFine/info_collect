Brooke-Spiegler syndrome: Multiple tumors arising from structures in 
the skin such as hair follicles and sweat glands characterize the syndrome. Mutations in a gene known as CYLD cause Brooke-Spiegler syndrome. These mutations are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a> in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning only one copy of the defective gene is necessary to cause the condition. However, a second non-inherited mutation is necessary for the development of the skin tumors. The skin tumors that occur in Brooke-Spiegler syndrome are usually benign but are occasionally <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">malignant</a>, or cancerous. Trichoepitheliomas, spiradenomas, and cylindromas are among the types of skin and skin appendage tumors that occur in people with this condition.
