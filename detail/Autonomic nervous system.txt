Autonomic nervous system: A part of the nervous system that regulates key involuntary functions of the body, including the activity of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9658" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">heart muscle</a>; the smooth muscles, including the muscles of the intestinal tract; and the glands. The autonomic nervous system has two divisions: the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5607" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">sympathetic nervous system</a>, which accelerates the heart rate, constricts blood vessels, and raises blood pressure, and the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4770" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">parasympathetic nervous system</a>, which slows the heart rate, increases intestinal and gland activity, and relaxes sphincter muscles.
