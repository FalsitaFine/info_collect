Intensive care unit psychosis:  A disorder in which patients 
in an intensive care unit (ICU) or a similar hospital setting may 
experience anxiety, become paranoid, hear voices, see things that are 
not there, become severely disoriented in time and place, become very 
agitated, even violent, etc. The condition has been formally defined 
as "acute brain syndrome involving impaired intellectual functioning 
which occurs in patients who are being treated within a critical care 
unit."  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/icu_psychosis/article.htm">ICU psychosis</a> is a form of delirium, or acute brain failure. 
Organic factors including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm">dehydration</a>, hypoxia (low blood oxygen), 
heart failure (inadequate cardiac output), infection and drugs can 
cause or contribute to delirium.

The treatment of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/icu_psychosis/article.htm">ICU psychosis</a> depends on the cause(s).  Family 
members, familiar objects and calm words may help. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm">Dehydration</a> should 
call for fluids. Heart failure needs treatment with digitalis. 
Infections must be diagnosed and treated.  Sedation with anti-
psychotics agents may help. 

To prevent ICU psychosis, many critical care units now have 
instituted visiting hours, they try to minimize shift changes in the 
nursing staff caring for a patient, the lighting is coordinated with 
the normal day-night cycle, etc. ICU psychosis usually goes away when 
the patient leaves the ICU. 


One patient in every 3 who spends more than 5 days in an ICU 
experiences some form of psychotic reaction, according to current 
estimates.  As the number of intensive care units and the number of 
people in them grow,  ICU  psychosis is perforce increasing as a 
problem.

What causes ICU psychosis is not fully known. Something about the ICU 
causes some people, who are already experiencing great debility, 
stress and pain, to "lose their minds." Among the factors which are 
believed to play into ICU psychosis are:
<ul><li>Sensory deprivation (being put in a room often without 
windows, away from family, friends and all that is familiar),</li>
<li>Sensory overload (being tethered to noisy machines day and 
night),</li>
<li>Pain (which may not be adequately controlled in an ICU),</li>
<li><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm">Sleep</a> deprivation, </li>
<li>Disruption of the normal day-night rhythm, or simply 
<li>The loss of control over their lives that patients often feel in 
an ICU.</li></li></ul>

ICU psychosis often goes away with the coming of morning or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm">sleep</a>. 
Although it may linger through the day, severe agitation usually 
occurs only at night. (This phenomenon, called sundowning, is common 
in nursing homes).
