Glandular fever: Glandular <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm">fever</a> is infectious
mononucleosis. "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infectious_mononucleosis/article.htm">Mono</a>" and "kissing disease" are popular terms for this
very common illness caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). By the time most people reach
adulthood, an antibody against EBV can be detected in their blood meaning they have been
infected with EBV. The illness is less severe in young children. The infection can be
spread by saliva. The incubation period for "mono" is 4 to 8 weeks. Symptoms
include fever, fatigue, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm">sore throat</a>, and swollen lymph glands. "Mono" can cause
liver inflammation (hepatitis) and spleen enlargement. Vigorous contact sports should be
avoided to prevent spleen rupture.
