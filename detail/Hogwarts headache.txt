Hogwarts headache: A generalized <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a> from spending many hours reading an unusually long volume such as one of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books. The pain resolves one to two days after the patient finishes the book. The term was coined by Dr. Howard J. Bennett in a Letter to the Editor of The New England Journal of Medicine on October 30, 2003. Dr. Bennett's letter was entitled "Hogwarts Headaches - Misery for Muggles." Hogwarts refers to Harry's alma mater -- Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
