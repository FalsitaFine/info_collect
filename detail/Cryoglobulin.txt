Cryoglobulin: An abnormal blood protein that has the unusual properties of precipitating from the blood serum when it is chilled (hence the "cryo-") and redissolving when it is rewarmed. Cryoglobulins are gamma globulins with a molecular weight of approximately 200,000.
Cryoglobulins can cause problems by causing the blood to be abnormally "thick" which increases the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clots</a> forming in the brain (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stroke</a>), eyes, and heart. Cryoglobulins are also associated with inflammation of blood vessels (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vasculitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vasculitis</a>) which increases the risk of blockage of arteries.
Cryoglobulins are a key part of a condition called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/essential_mixed_cryoglobulinemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">essential mixed cryoglobulinemia</a>. Cryoglobulins can also accompany diseases such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_myeloma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">multiple myeloma</a>, dermatomyositis, and lymphoma. Sometimes small amounts of cryoglobulin are discovered by accident in the lab in a serum sample from someone with no apparent symptoms.
