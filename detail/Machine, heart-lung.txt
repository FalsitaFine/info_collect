Machine, heart-lung: A machine that does the work both of the heart and of the lungs: pumping and oxygenating blood. Blood returning to the heart is diverted through a heart-lung machine before being returned to arterial circulation. Such machines may be used during open-heart surgery. Also known as pump-oxygenator or cardiopulmonary bypass machine.
