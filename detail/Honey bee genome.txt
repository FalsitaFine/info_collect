Honey bee genome: The genetic complement of the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Its genome is relatively small -- about one-tenth the size of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3818" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">human genome</a> -- and contains about 300 million DNA base pairs. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5465" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Sequencing</a> of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=26056" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">bee genome</a> began in 2003 and a draft of it was completed in 2004. The bee genome may also help understand the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15390" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">genetics</a> of social behavior.
