Hamstring: One of the prominent tendons at the back of the knee. The hamstrings are the side walls of the hollow behind the knee (popliteal space). Both hamstrings connect to muscles that flex the knee. The term is sometimes used to refer to the muscles in the back of the thigh. A pulled hamstring is a common athletic injury.
