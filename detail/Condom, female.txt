Condom, female:  Although the word "condom" usually conjures up the male condom, there is a female condom. The Reality Female Condom was approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 1993. It consists of a lubricated polyurethane sheath shaped similarly to the male condom. The closed end, which has a flexible ring, is inserted into the vagina, while the open end remains outside, partially covering the labia.
