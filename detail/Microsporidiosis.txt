Microsporidiosis: a disease caused by small parasites known as <i>Microsporidia</i>.
These parasites typically do not cause problems in healthy people, but may cause disease in people with suppressed immune function. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/microsporidiosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Microsporidiosis</a> can cause intestinal problems such as chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_disease_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">kidney disease</a>, and infection of the sinuses and eyes, including microsporidia <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/keratitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">keratitis</a>. Symptoms depend upon the area of the body that is infected. Microsporidia spores are released from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_changes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stool</a>, respiratory secretions, and urine of infected animals (insects, birds, and mammals) and humans. The process by which the parasite is transmitted among humans is not completely understood, but ingestion or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inhalation</a> of the spores is a likely cause.
