Immunization, anthrax: A series of six shots over six
months and booster shots annually, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anthrax/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anthrax</a> vaccine now in use in the USA was first
developed in the 1950s and approved by the Food and Drug Administration for general use in
1970. It is produced by the Michigan Biologic Products Institute of Michigan's
Department of Health and is given routinely to veterinarians and others working with
livestock. In December, 1997 it was announced that all US military would receive the
vaccine, as do the military in the UK and Russia, the reason being concern that anthrax
might be used in biologic warfare.
