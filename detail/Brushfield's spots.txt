Brushfield's spots: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6332" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Speckled iris</a>. Little white spots that slightly elevated on the surface of the iris arranged in a ring concentric with the pupil. These spots occur in normal children but are far more frequent in Down's syndrome (trisomy 21). They were described in 1924 by Thomas Brushfield and are due to aggregation of a normal iris element (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2824" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">connective tissue</a>).
