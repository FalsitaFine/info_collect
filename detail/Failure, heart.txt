Failure, heart: Inability of the heart to 
keep up with the demands on it and, specifically, failure of the 
heart to pump 
blood with normal 
efficiency. When this occurs, 
the heart is unable to provide adequate blood 
flow to other organs such as the brain, liver and kidneys. Heart 
failure may be due to failure of the right or left or both 
ventricles. The signs and symptoms depend upon which side of the 
heart is failing. They can include shortness of breath (dyspnea), 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm"> asthma</a> due to the heart (cardiac <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm">asthma</a>), pooling of blood (stasis) in 
the general body (systemic) circulation or in the liver's (portal) 
circulation, swelling (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm">edema</a>), 
blueness or duskiness (cyanosis), and enlargement (hypertrophy) of 
the 
heart. There 
are many causes of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/congestive_heart_failure_chf_overview/article.htm">congestive heart failure</a> including: (1) coronary 
artery disease leading to heart attacks and heart muscle weakness, 
(2) 
primary heart muscle weakness from viral infections or toxins such as 
prolonged alcohol exposure, (3) heart valve disease causing heart 
muscle 
weakness due to too much leaking of blood or heart muscle stiffness 
from a blocked valve, and (4) hypertension (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm">high blood pressure</a>). 
Rarer causes include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthyroidism/article.htm">hyperthyroidism</a> (high thyroid hormone), vitamin 
deficiency, and excess amphetamine ("speed") use. The aim of therapy 
is to improve the pumping function of the 
heart.  General treatment includes salt restriction, diuretics (to 
get rid of excess fluid), 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/digoxin/article.htm"> digoxin</a> (to strengthen the heart), and other medications. Specific 
treatment of 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/congestive_heart_failure_chf_overview/article.htm"> congestive heart failure</a> needs also to be directed toward the 
specific underlying 
cause of the problem.
