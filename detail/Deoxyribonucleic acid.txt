Deoxyribonucleic acid: DNA. One of two types of molecules 
that encode genetic information. (The other is RNA. In humans DNA is the genetic material; RNA is transcribed from it. In some other organisms, RNA is the genetic material and, in reverse fashion, the DNA is transcribed from it.)  
DNA is a double-stranded molecule held together by weak hydrogen bonds between base pairs of nucleotides. The molecule forms a double helix in which two strands of DNA spiral about one other. The double helix looks something like an immensely long ladder twisted into a helix, or coil. The sides of the "ladder" are formed by a backbone of sugar and phosphate molecules, and the "rungs" consist of nucleotide bases joined weakly in the middle by the hydrogen bonds.  
There are four nucleotides in DNA. Each nucleotide 
contains a base: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), or thymine 
(T). Base pairs form naturally only between A and T and between G and 
C so the base sequence of each single strand of DNA can be simply 
deduced from that of its partner strand. 
The genetic code in DNA is in triplets such 
as ATG. The base sequence of that triplet in the partner strand is 
therefore TAC. 
The first proof that DNA was the hereditary material 
was provided in 1944 by Oswald Avery, Maclyn McCarty and Colin 
MacLoed. The double helical structure of DNA was discovered in 1953 
by James D. Watson and Francis H.C. Crick with the invaluable 
collaboration of the X-ray crystallographer Rosalind Franklin. Watson 
and Crick shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with 
Maurice H.F. Wilkins.
