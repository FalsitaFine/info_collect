Muscular dystrophy, congenital: A form of 
muscular dystrophy that is present at birth. Various types 
of congenital MD have been identified, each caused by a 
different genetic error. Congenital MD can affect males or 
females. Diagnosis is initially by observation of general 
muscle weakness (hypotonia). See also muscular 
dystrophy, myotonic.
