Neti pot: A ceramic pot used for nasal saline irrigation of the nasal passages. Saline irrigation involves flushing the nasal passages with a salt and water solution to thin the mucus and facilitate drainage of the sinuses. A Neti pot resembles a small teapot, shaped somewhat like the depictions of Aladdin's magic lamp. Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialists may recommend nasal irrigation with a Neti pot to help clear crusting in the nasal passages. Many people with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sinusitis/article.htm">chronic sinus symptoms</a> use the Neti pot to alleviate congestion, facial pain and pressure, and reduce the need for antibiotics and nasal sprays. Nasal saline irrigation can safely be performed at home, but it is important to discuss this procedure with your physician. Mild side effects of Neti pot use can be nasal irritation and/or a stinging sensation.
