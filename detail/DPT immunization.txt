DPT immunization: Immunization to protect against <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diphtheria_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diphtheria</a>, pertussis (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pertussis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">whooping cough</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tetanus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tetanus</a>. DPT immunizations are given in a series of 5 shots at
2, 4, 6, 18 months of age and 4-6 years of age. Thanks to vaccination programs, these
diseases have become less common. However, there are still unvaccinated individuals
capable of carrying and passing diphtheria and pertussis to others who are not vaccinated.
Tetanus bacteria are prevalent in natural surroundings, such as contaminated soil. See
