Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test: A blood serum screening test for syphilis designed to demonstrate the presence or absence of specific antibodies directed against the organism <i>(<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5849" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Treponema pallidum</a>)</i> responsible for syphilis.   The fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed (FTA-ABS) test detects the majority but not all cases of the disease. It is thus a way of screening for the disease.   A negative FTA-ABS test result is consistent with a person not having syphilis. However, a person may have a negative FTA-ABS test result while in the early (primary) and late (tertiary) stages of the disease. In the middle (secondary) stage of syphilis, the FTA-ABS test is most reliable and is reportedly positive in 100% of cases..
