The formation of acetone is usually a sign that cells lack <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insulin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">insulin</a> or cannot effectively use the insulin that is available, as occurs in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a>. Acetone is excreted from the body in the urine.
