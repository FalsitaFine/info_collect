Dyspeptic: Pertaining to dyspepsia, a term that is probably more often encountered today in advertising than in medicine. "Dyspepsia" refers to nondescript, nonspecific upper abdominal symptoms which may include discomfort, bloating, a feeling of unusual fullness with very little intake of food (early satiety) or following meals (postprandial fullness), nausea, loss of appetite, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heartburn_reflux/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heartburn</a>, regurgitation of food or acid, and belching.  The term "dyspepsia" may be used for these symptoms when they are not typical of a specific disease as, for example, gastrointestinal reflux (GERD), and the cause of the upper abdominal symptoms is not clear. Once a cause for the symptoms has been determined, the term "dyspepsia" usually is dropped in favor of a more specific diagnosis such as gastric ulcer, GERD, etc. Attempts have been made to subcategorize dyspepsia into ulcer-like, dysmotility-like, reflux-like, and unspecified; however, the utility of this categorization is unclear. Subdividing such a nebulous condition is a dubious endeavor.
A French writer (1862) called dyspepsia "the remorse of a guilty stomach." The word "dyspepsia" came into English usage in 1706. It was contrived by cementing "dys-" to the Greek "pepsis" (digestion) = dysdigestion = <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dyspepsia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">indigestion</a>.
