Fear of demons: An abnormal and persistent fear of evil supernatural beings in persons who believe such beings exist and roam freely to cause harm. Those who suffer from this phobia realize their fear is excessive or irrational. Nevertheless, they become unduly anxious when discussing demons, when venturing alone into woods or a dark house, or when watching films about demonic possession and exorcism.
Fear of evil spirits is termed "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=12215" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">demonophobia</a>," a word derived from the Greek "daimon" (deity, evil spirit) and "phobos" (fear). "Daimon" also gives us the English word "demonize," a verb widely used today to brand a person, such as a political opponent, as unfit or untrustworthy.
