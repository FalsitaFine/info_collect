A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4284" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">marker chromosome</a> is not necessarily a marker for a specific disease or abnormality, but it can be distinguished under the microscope from all the normal human chromosomes. For example, the fragile X (FRAXA) chromosome was once called the marker X.
