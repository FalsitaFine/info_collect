There are many types of baldness, each with a different cause. Baldness may be localized to the front and top of the head, as in the very common type of male-pattern baldness; baldness may be patchy, a condition called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alopecia_areata/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">alopecia areata</a>; or a variant of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/alopecia_areata_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">alopecia areata</a> may involve the entire head: alopecia capitis totalis. The word "alopecia" comes from the Greek "alopex" for "fox."
