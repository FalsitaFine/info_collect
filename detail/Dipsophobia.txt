Dipsophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of drinking alcohol. Sufferers of dipsophobia experience undue <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a> about addiction to alcohol and the effect this addiction can have on their body. (However, their abstinence from alcohol certainly should not be criticized.)
"Dipsophobia" is derived from the Greek "dipsa" (thirst) and "phobos" (fear). "Dipsa" is also used to form the words "dipsomania" (an abnormal craving for alcohol) and "dipsosis" (a medical condition characterized by abnormal thirst).
