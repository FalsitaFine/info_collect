Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome: A form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11679">mucopolysaccharidosis</a> with the clinical onset before age 3 that is characterized by an inability to metabolize dermatan sulfate. This leads to abnormal accumulation of dermatan sulfate, resulting in mild to severe changes in muscle, 
bone, skin, and other tissues, particularly the heart. 
Diagnosis is by examining <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4145">leukocytes</a> and cultured skin 
fibroblasts, or 24-hour urine collection to search for high 
levels of dermatan sulfate. There is no current treatment 
for the syndrome, but individual symptoms and 
problems may respond to physical therapy, medication, or 
surgery. Due to heart damage, death usually occurs before 
age 40. Also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type VI. See
