Endometriosis uterina: Also known as adenomyosis (pronounced
ad-den-o-mi-o-sis), this is a common benign condition of the uterus in which
the endometrium (the mucous membrane lining the inside of the uterus) grows
into the myometrium (the uterine musculature located just outside the
endometrium). The endometrium and myometrium under normal circumstances live
adjacent to one another as discrete neighbors. In adenomyosis, the
endometrium trespasses upon the myometrium. The myometrium may respond to
this intrusion with muscular overgrowth. If an island of endometrial tissue
is contained and circumscribed within the myometrium, it forms a nodule
called an adenomyoma (plural: adenomyomata). Adenomyosis is made up of adeno
(gland) + myo (muscle) +osis (a condition of) = a condition of glandular
tissue (referring to the endometrium) in the muscle (the myometrium).
Adenomyosis goes by several other names including  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endometriosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">endometriosis</a> interna,
adenomyosis uteri and adenomyometritis.
