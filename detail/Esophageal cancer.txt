Esophageal cancer: A malignant <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> of the esophagus. The risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> of the esophagus is increased by long-term irritation of the esophagus, such as from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smoking</a>, heavy alcohol intake, and Barrett <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/esophagitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">esophagitis</a>. Very small tumors in the esophagus usually do not cause symptoms. As a tumor grows, the most common symptom is difficulty in swallowing. There may be a feeling of fullness, pressure, or burning as food passes down the esophagus. Cancer of the esophagus can also cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dyspepsia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">indigestion</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heartburn_reflux/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heartburn</a>, vomiting, and frequent choking on food. Because of these problems, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a> is common. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/esophageal_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Esophageal cancer</a> can be diagnosed through a barium X-ray study of the esophagus and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endoscopy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">endoscopy</a> and biopsy of the tumor. Treatment includes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chemotherapy</a> and sometimes surgery.
