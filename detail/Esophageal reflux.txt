Esophageal reflux: A condition wherein stomach contents
regurgitate or back up (reflux) into the esophagus (a long cylindrical tube that
transports food from the mouth to the stomach). The food in the stomach is partially
digested by stomach acid and enzymes. Normally, the partially digested acid content in the
stomach is delivered by the stomach muscle into the small intestine for further digestion.
In esophageal reflux, stomach acid content refluxes backwards up into the esophagus,
occasionally reaching the breathing passages, causing inflammation and damage to the
esophagus, as well as to the lung and larynx (the voice box). The process is medically
termed <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a> (GERD). 10% of patients with GERD develop a
Barrett's esophagus which can increase the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/esophageal_cancer/article.htm">cancer of the esophagus</a>.
