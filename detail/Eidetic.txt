Eidetic: 1. Marked by extraordinarily accurate and vivid recall, especially of images.  
2. By extension, an individual with such exceptional powers.
Eidetic memory is the ability to see in one's mind's eye in the most minute detail. From the German eidetisch, from the Greek eidetikos and eidos (form), and ultimately from the Indo-European root weid- (to see).
