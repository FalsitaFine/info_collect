Aspiration, joint: A procedure whereby a sterile needle and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9462">syringe</a> are used to drain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4074">joint</a> fluid from the joint. This is usually done as an office procedure or at the bedside in the hospital. The procedure is also known medically as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7090">arthrocentesis</a>,  
For an arthrocentesis, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7901">skin</a> over the joint is sterilized with a liquid. Local <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2247">anesthetic</a> is applied to the area of the joint either by injection or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9878">topical</a> liquid freezing, or both.  A needle with a syringe attached is inserted within the joint and fluid is sucked back (aspirated).  For certain conditions medication is put into the joint after fluid removal.  The needle is then removed and a bandaid or dressing is applied over the entry point.
 Joint fluid is typically sent for examination to the lab to determine the cause of the joint swelling, such as infection, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3624">gout</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5354">rheumatoid arthritis</a>.
Arthrocentesis can be helpful in relieving joint swelling and pain. Occasionally, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6547">cortisone</a> medications are injected into the joint during the arthrocentesis in order to rapidly relieve joint <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3979">inflammation</a> and further reduce symptoms.
