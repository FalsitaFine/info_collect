Arginine: An essential amino acid and a key component of protein. Lack of arginine in the diet impairs growth, and in adult males it decreases the sperm count. Arginine is available in turkey, chicken, and other meats, and as L-arginine in supplements. Babies born without the enzyme phosphate synthetase have arginine deficiency syndrome; adding arginine to their diets permits normal growth and development.
