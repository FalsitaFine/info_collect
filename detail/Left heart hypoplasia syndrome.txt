Left heart hypoplasia syndrome:   
A form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/congenital_heart_disease/article.htm">congenital heart disease</a> in which the whole left 
half of the heart (including the aorta, aortic valve, left 
ventricle and mitral valve) is underdeveloped 
(hypoplastic). Blood returning from the lungs has to flow 
through an opening in the wall between the upper chambers 
of the heart (an atrial septal defect). The right ventricle 
pumps blood into the pulmonary artery, and blood reaches 
the aorta through a shunt (the ductus arteriosus). The 
child may seem normal at birth but have trouble within a 
few days of birth (when the ductus closes), become ashen, 
have rapid and difficult breathing and have problems 
feeding. This heart defect is usually fatal within the 
first days or months of life without treatment, namely a 
sequence of surgical operations or a heart transplant.
