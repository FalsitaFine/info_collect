encephalitis (that can cause convulsions, mental 
retardation. and even death), the sudden onset of low blood 
platelet levels with severe bleeding (acute 
thrombocytopenic purpura) or a chronic brain disease that 
occurs months to often years after an attack of measles 
(subacute sclerosing panencephalitis). During pregnancy 
measles may trigger miscarriages or premature delivery. 
Measles can be prevented through vaccination. The disease 
is also called (depending on how long you think it lasts) 
the seven-day measles, eight-day measles, nine-day measles, 
or the ten-day measles, and morbilli. The name measles 
comes from the Middle English maselen meaning many little 
spots referring, of course, to the rash.
