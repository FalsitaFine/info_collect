Endarterectomy: An operation to clean out an artery and restore normal blood flow through the artery.  An endarterectomy is basically a "Rotorooter" procedure. It removes diseased material from the inside of an artery, and also removes any occluding atheromatous deposits, the aim being to leave a smooth lining within the vessel, so the blood can flow normally. A coronary endarterectomy involves the removal (excision) of occluding material from a coronary artery (one of the arteries in the heart muscle).
