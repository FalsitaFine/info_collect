Chronic recurrent multi-focal osteomyelitis: a rare, inflammatory bone condition that causes episodes of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/swollen_joints/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">joint swelling</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Fever</a> may be present. The symptoms of CRMO typically begin in childhood and recur over time. It may affect a few sites or many sites within the body. CRMO may occur alone or in combination with other conditions like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriasis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">psoriasis</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/inflammatory_bowel_disease_intestinal_problems/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. In most cases CRMO resolves after many years without lasting complications, but it can sometimes cause delays in growth and permanent bone deformities.
