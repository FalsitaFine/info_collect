In situ hybridization, fluorescent: An important molecular cytogenetic method for identifying chromosomes and parts of chromosomes, deciphering chromosome rearrangements, and locating genes on chromosomes. "Fluorescent" means emitting light that comes from a reaction within the emitter. "In situ" refers to the fact that this techniques is done with the chromosomes, cells or tissue in place (in situ) on a microscope slide. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3988" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">In situ hybridization</a> is  a technique in which single-stranded <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15378" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">nucleic acids</a> (DNA or RNA) are permitted to interact so that complexes, or hybrids, are formed by molecules with sufficiently similar, complementary sequences. Through <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=14349" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">nucleic acid hybridization</a>, the degree of sequence identity can be determined and specific sequences detected and sometimes those sequences can be located on a specific chromosome. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4594" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">nucleic acid</a> labelled with a fluorescent dye is hybridized to suitably prepared cells or histological sections. This is used particularly to look for specific transcription or localization of genes to specific chromosomes. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3486" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Fluorescent in situ hybridization</a> is abbreviated FISH.
