Aortic valve: One of the four valves in the 
heart, this valve is situated at exit of the left ventricle of the 
heart where the aorta (the largest of all arteries) begins. 
The aortic valve lets blood from the left ventricle be pumped up 
(ejected) into the aorta but prevents blood once 
it is in the aorta from returning to the heart.
