Branchial cyst: Also called a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/branchial_cyst/article.htm">branchial cleft cyst</a>,
this is a cavity that is a remnant from embryologic development present at birth in one
side of the neck just in front of the large angulated muscle on either side (the
sternocleidomastoid muscle). The cyst may not be recognized until adolescence as it
enlarges its oval shape. It may develop a sinus or drainage pathway to the surface of the
skin from which mucus can be expressed. Total surgical excision is the treatment of
choice. Recurrence is not expected.
