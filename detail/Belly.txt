Belly: That part of the body 
that contains all of the structures between the chest and 
the pelvis. Also called the abdomen.
The belly (or abdomen) is separated anatomically from the chest by the diaphragm, the powerful muscle spanning the body cavity below the lungs. 
The belly contains a host of organs including the stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, appendix, 
gallbladder, and bladder. 
The word "abdomen" has a curious story behind it. It comes 
from the Latin "abdodere", to hide. The idea was that whatever was 
eaten was hidden in the abdomen.
