Female: The traditional definition of female was
"an individual of the sex that bears young" or "that produces ova or
eggs". However, things are not so simple today. Female can be defined by physical
appearance, by chromosome constitution (see Female chromosome complement), or by gender
identification. Female chromosome complement: The large majority of females have a 46, XX
chromosome complement (46 chromosomes including two X chromosomes). A minority of females
have other chromosome constitutions such as 45,X (45 chromosomes including only one X
chromosome) and 47,XXX (47 chromosomes including three X chromosomes).
