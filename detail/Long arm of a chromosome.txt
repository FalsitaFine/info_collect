Long arm of a chromosome: The long arm of a 
chromosome is termed the q arm. All human chromosomes have 
2 arms,  the p (short) arm and the q (long) arm.   
They are separated from each other only by a primary 
constriction, the centromere, the point at which the 
chromosome is attached to the spindle during cell division. 
The symbol "p" stands for "petit", small in French,
while "q" was chosen merely because it was the next letter 
in the alphabet.
