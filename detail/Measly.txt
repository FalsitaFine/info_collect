Measly: The word measly can refer to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/measles_rubeola/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">measles</a>, and,
thence, to spotty and, thence, to something that is of little value. In medicine, the
measly tapeworm is the pork tapeworm (T. solium) which can be contracted through eating
measly pork (pork infected with the larval form of T. solium).
