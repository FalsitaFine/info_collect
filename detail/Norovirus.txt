Norovirus: A group of viruses that are a common cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/food_poisoning/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">food poisoning</a> and acute <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroenteritis_stomach_flu/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gastroenteritis</a> ("stomach <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">flu</a>") that can strike quickly with force and make a person feel very sick but which typically resolves within 2-3 days. The characteristic symptoms are nausea, vomiting, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a>, and abdominal cramping. The diarrhea is not bloody. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Fever</a>, if present, is low-grade. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Dehydration</a> is the main complication, especially in infants and the elderly, and may need medical attention. The clinical criteria for the diagnosis of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/norovirus_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">norovirus infection</a> include: <ol>
<li>an incubation period of 12-36 hours; <li>an illness characterized by acute onset of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and, in some cases, fever and malaise; <li>an illness of 12-60 hours duration. </li></li></li></ol>
The virus is spread primarily from one infected person to another (by the fecal-oral route). Infected kitchen workers can contaminate a salad or sandwich as they prepare it, if they have the virus on their hands. Infected fishermen have contaminated oysters as they harvested them. Norovirus infection has become a veritable <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plague_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">plague</a> on cruise ships. Norovirus was coined to refer to the Norwalk-like virus by a simpler and more memorable term. It is now the official name. Also called the calicivirus because of its characteristic "Star of David" shape with cup-shaped (chalice) indentations.
