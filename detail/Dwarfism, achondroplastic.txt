Dwarfism, achondroplastic: A genetic disorder of bone growth, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/achondroplasia/article.htm">achondroplasia</a> is the most common cause of short stature with disproportionately short limbs -- dwarfism with short arms and legs. There is a typically large head with prominence of the forehead (frontal bossing), underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the midface with 
cheekbones that lack prominence, and a low nasal bridge with narrow nasal passages. The fingers are short and the 
ring and middle fingers diverge giving the hand a trident (three-pronged) appearance.
