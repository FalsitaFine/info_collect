Capillary: A tiny blood vessel that connects an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2335" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">arteriole</a> (the smallest division of an artery) with a venule (the smallest division of a vein). Although tiny, the capillary plays an imortant role in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2738" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">circulatory system</a>. The walls of capillaries act as semipermeable membranes that permit the exchange of various substances, including fluids and the gases oxygen and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=20132" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">carbon dioxide</a>, between the blood stream and the tissues of the body.
