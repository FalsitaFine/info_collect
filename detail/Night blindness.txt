Night blindness: Impaired vision in 
dim light and in the dark, due to impaired function of 
specific vision cells (namely, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10548">rods</a>) in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7931">retina</a>. 

The ability of our eyes to quickly view objects as 
they shift from light to dark areas and the ability to see in dim light or at night is an important part of our visual health. When we are not able to do such, the condition is referred to commonly as night blindness or medically as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6448">nyctalopia</a>. It occurs as a result of various diseases that cause degeneration of the rods of the retina (the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15733">sensory</a> cells responsible for vision in dim light). The problem can also appear as an inherited deficiency in visual purple, or rhodopsin, which is the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.comhttps://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm9">pigment</a> of the rods of the retina. The abnormality can also result from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11211">vitamin A deficiency</a>. Rhodopsin,Â  maintains its <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4883">photosensitivity</a> only in the presence of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8661">vitamin A</a>.

Night blindness is a classic finding from deficiency of vitamin 
A. It was described by the English physician William 
Heberden (1710-1801) who also discovered other medical disorders 
of importance including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6594">angina</a> pectoris (chest pain that is often severe and crushing, due to an inadequate supply of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10690">oxygen</a> to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3668">heart</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4464">muscle</a>) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4675">osteoarthritis</a> of the small joints with nodules (Heberden's nodes) in and about the last <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4074">joint</a> of the finger. 
Sources of vitamin A include animal livers, milk, and yellow and green leafy vegetables which contain carotenes, chemically related substances that are converted to vitamin A in the body.
Night blindness is also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6621">day sight</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6447">nocturnal amblyopia</a>, 
nyctalopia and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6449">nyctanopia</a>.
