Nails, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ringworm/article.htm">ringworm</a> of the: The most common fungus 
infection of the nails, also called onychomycosis.
Onychomycosis makes the nails look white and opaque, thickened, 
and brittle. Those at increased risk for developing onychomycosis 
include:<ul>
<li>People with diabetes;</li>
<li>People with disease of the small blood vessels (peripheral 
vascular disease); and
<li>Older women (perhaps because estrogen deficiency increases the 
risk of infection); and </li>
<li>Women of any age who wear artificial nails (acrylic or 
"wraps").</li></li></ul>
 
Artificial nails increase the risk for onychomycosis because, when an 
artificial nail is applied, the nail surface is usually abraded with 
an emery board damaging it, emery boards can carry infection, and 
water can collect under the artificial nail creating a moist, warm
environment favorable for fungal growth.
 Alternative names for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ringworm/article.htm">ringworm</a> of the nails include tinea unguium 
and dermatophytic onychomycosis.
