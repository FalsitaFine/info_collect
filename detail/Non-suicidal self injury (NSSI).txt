<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/suicide/article.htm">suicidal intent</a> or ideation. Examples of NSSI include cutting, burning, stabbing, or excessive rubbing. The behaviors of NSSI are performed with the expectation that the injury produced will be minor to moderate and will not be life-threatening. So-called "common and trivial" behaviors such as nail biting are not included in the proposed definition for NSSI, nor are socially sanctioned practices such as piercing and tattooing.
