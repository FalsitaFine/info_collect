Meninges: The three membranes that cover the brain 
and spinal
cord (singular: meninx). The outside meninx is called the dura mater, and is 
the most resilient of the three. The center layer is the arachnoid membrane and 
the thin innermost layer is the pia mater. Inflammation of the meninges 
(meningitis) can occur due to bacterial infection.See also <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10375">meningitis</a> article.
