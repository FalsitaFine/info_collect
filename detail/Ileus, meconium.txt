Ileus, meconium: Obstruction of the intestine due to overly thick meconium, a dark, sticky substance that is normally present in the intestine at birth. Meconium is passed in the feces after birth, after trypsin and other enzymes from the pancreas have acted on it. Meconium ileus occurs when the infant has a deficiency of trypsin and other digestive enzymes from the pancreas, as in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cystic_fibrosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cystic fibrosis</a>.
