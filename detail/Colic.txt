Colic: A cause of crampy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abdominal pain</a> in early infancy. Colic is a common condition, occurring in about 1 in 10 babies. An infant with colic is irritable, cries, and often has a rigid abdomen and draws up its legs. Overfeeding, undiluted juices, food allergies, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a> can aggravate colic. Colic usually lasts from early infancy to the third or fourth month of age. Treatment can include dietary changes, carefully measured feedings, and extra burping. Parents should not assume that new abdominal pain and loud crying in their baby are colic. It is important for the baby to be seen by a physician to rule out more serious conditions.
