Acute epiglottitis: A rapidly progressive infection causing inflammation of the epiglottis (the flap that covers the trachea) and tissues around the epiglottis that may lead to abrupt blockage of the upper airway and death. The infection is usually caused by bacteria.  The inflamed epiglottis mechanically obstructs the airway and impairs the breathing process.
