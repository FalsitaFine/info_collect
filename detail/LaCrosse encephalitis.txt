LaCrosse encephalitis: One of the main types of encephalitis caused by an arthropod-borne (carried by a mosquito, tick or another kind of arthropod) virus. The virus infects and inflames the brain. LAC encephalitis was first found in a 4-year-old in LaCrosse, Wisconsin in 1963. Since then, the virus has been identified in a number of Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic states. During an average year, about 75 cases of LAC encephalitis are reported to the CDC.
