Myelitis, transverse: A disease of the spinal cord in which there is demyelination (erosion of the myelin sheath that normally protects nerve fibers).  The onset of the disorder is typically sudden. Symptoms include back pain followed by ascending weakness in the legs.  There is no cure. Many patients are left with permanent disabilities or paralysis.  Transverse myelitis occurs alone and in combination with demyelination of other parts of the nervous system. It may be associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">multiple sclerosis</a>.

Transverse myelitis can cause low back pain, spinal cord dysfunction, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_spasms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">muscle spasms</a>, a general feeling of discomfort, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a>, loss of appetite, and numbness or tingling in the legs. Almost all patients develop leg weakness. The arms are involved in a minority of cases. (This depends upon the level of spinal cord involvement.) Sensation, pain and temperature sensation  are typically diminished below the level of spinal cord involvement. Appreciation of vibration and joint position sense may also be decreased. Bladder and bowel sphincter control is disturbed in the majority of cases. Many patients with transverse myelitis report a tight banding or girdle-like sensation around the trunk and that area may be very sensitive to touch.
