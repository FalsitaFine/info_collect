ERCP: Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography, a diagnostic procedure used to examine diseases of the liver, bile ducts, and pancreas. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ercp/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ERCP</a> is usually performed under intravenous sedation rather than general anesthesia. ERCP provides important information that cannot be obtained by other means. Therapeutic measures can often be taken at the time of ERCP to remove stones in the bile ducts or to relieve obstructions of the bile ducts.
