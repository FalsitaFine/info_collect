Flexural psoriasis: A form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriasis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">psoriasis</a> found in the armpits, groin, under the breasts and in other flexion creases (skin folds) such as those around the genitals and buttocks. This form of psoriasis appears as smooth areas of skin that are red and inflamed but do not have the scaling associated with plaque psoriasis (the most common type of psoriasis). Flexural psoriasis is more frequent and severe in people who are overweight because it is in the skin folds where it is particularly prone to irritation from rubbing and sweating. Also called inverse psoriasis.
