Fart:   This is not an accepted 
medical word for passing gas. Excess gas in the 
intestinal is medically termed "flatulence."  (But what is 
excess gas is difficult to define since symptom-free 
individuals have recorded approximately 14 passages of gas 
per 24 hours!)
The Oxford English Dictionary (OED), in its inimitable way, notes that the word "fart" is "not in decent use." The OED defines the transitive verb form of fart: "To send forth as 
wind from the anus 1632." The word comes from the Old 
English "feortan" (meaning "to break wind"). Although the word "fart" is "not in decent use," it was used by 
the likes of the great English poet Geoffrey Chaucer.
