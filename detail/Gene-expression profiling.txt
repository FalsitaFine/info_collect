Gene-expression profiling: A genomic technique that based on the fact that only a fraction of the genes encoded in the genome of a cell are expressed by being transcribed into <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4357" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">messenger RNA</a> (mRNA). The complement of mRNAs in a cell largely dictates its complement of proteins. Consequently, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3564" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">gene expression</a> is a major determinant of the biology of both normal and malignant cells.
