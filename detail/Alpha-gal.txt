Alpha-gal: a carbohydrate (galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose) that has been identified as the cause of an unusual meat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergy</a> that develops after a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ticks/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tick bite</a>. The alpha-gal compound is found in the meat of all non-primate mammals. The 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergic symptoms</a> appear to be related to having experienced a bite from the Lone star tick (<i>Amblyomma americanum</i>). Unlike tick-borne infectious diseases like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lyme_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Lyme disease</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rocky_mountain_spotted_fever_rmsf/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever</a>, the alpha-gal reaction is a true <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">allergic reaction</a> to the alpha-gal compound in meat that develops in people who have had bites from this type of tick. It is not due to an infectious organism spread by the tick bite. The exact reason for the relationship to tick bites and development of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/10_common_allergy_triggers_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">allergy</a> is unknown. The Lone Star tick is found in the US, mainly in the southeast
and up to Iowa and into New England.
