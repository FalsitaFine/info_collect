persons can notice that are a result of a cancer. It is important to see your doctor for
regular checkups and not wait for problems to occur. But you should also know that the
following symptoms may be associated with cancer: changes in bowel or bladder habits, a
sore that does not heal, unusual bleeding or discharge, thickening or lump in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm">breast </a>
or any other part of the body, indigestion or difficulty swallowing, obvious change in a
wart or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/moles/article.htm">mole</a>, or nagging cough or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hoarseness/article.htm">hoarseness</a>. These symptoms are not always a sign of
cancer. They can also be caused by less serious conditions. Only a doctor can make a
diagnosis. It is important to see a doctor if you have any of these symptoms. Don't
wait to feel pain. Early cancer often does not cause pain.
