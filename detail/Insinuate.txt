Insinuate: In the biomedical sciences, to introduce slowly, through a winding or narrow passage, or by a persistent movement.   The term "insinuate" in this sense carries the connotation of introducing artfully and gently, as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11097" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cardiologist</a> would do in insinuating a catheter (a tube) into the arteries of ones heart.  The origin of "insinuate" is from the Latin <i>in-</i>, in + <i>sinus</i>, the bosom, meaning "in the bosom."
