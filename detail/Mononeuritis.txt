Mononeuritis: Inflammation of a single nerve. There are 
many causes of mononeuritis including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm">diabetes mellitus</a>, carpal 
tunnel syndrome, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lyme_disease/article.htm">Lyme disease</a>. The 
treatment of mononeuritis depends on the underlying cause.
Whereas mononeuritis involves only a single nerve, mononeuritis 
multiplex involves inflammation of two or more nerves, typically in 
unrelated portions of the body, causing a loss of function of the 
muscle tissue that is innervated by the affected nerve. For example, 
sudden loss of ability to normally lift the foot up while walking 
(foot drop) can be caused by mononeuritis multiplex when accompanied 
by loss of nerve function elsewhere in the body.
