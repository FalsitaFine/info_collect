constriction of one of the vessels that supply the heart
muscle with blood rich in oxygen. This deprives the heart 
muscle of blood and oxygen. Coronary artery spasm can be triggered by emotional stress, medicines, street drugs (cocaine) or
exposure to cold. Treatments include beta-blocker 
medications and, classically, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nitroglycerin/article.htm">nitroglycerin</a> to open up the coronary arteries.
Named for the American cardiologist, Myron Prinzmetal (1908-87).
