Jimmy Fund: A children's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> started in 1948 for a young cancer patient of Dr. Sidney Farber that wanted a television to watch his favorite baseball team.    The Variety Club of New England accepted contributions on behalf of “Jimmy” and in support of Dr. Farber’s chemotherapy research and what later became the Dana-Farber Institute. The fund continues to support adult and pediatric cancer care and research.
