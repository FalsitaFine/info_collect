Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) prevention: In many
cases, a person may have a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/transient_ischemic_attack_tia_mini-stroke/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">transient ischemic attack</a> (TIA), a neurological event with the
symptoms of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stroke</a>, but the symptoms go away within a short period of time, usually a few minutes to a few hours. This is
often caused by the narrowing or ulceration of the carotid arteries (the major arteries in
the neck that supply blood to the brain). If not treated, there is a high risk of having a
major stroke in the future. If you suspect a TIA, you should seek medical attention right
away. An operation to clean out the carotid artery and restore normal blood flow through
the artery (a carotid endarterectomy) markedly reduces the incidence of a subsequent
stroke. In other cases, when a person has a narrowed carotid artery, but no symptoms, the
risk of having a stroke can be reduced with medications such as aspirin and platelet-inhibiting blood thinners. These medications act by partially blocking the function of blood elements,
called platelets, which assist blood clotting.
