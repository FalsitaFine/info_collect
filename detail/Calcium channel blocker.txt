Calcium channel blocker: A drug
that blocks the entry of calcium into the muscle cells of the heart and the arteries. It is the entry of calcium into these cells that causes the heart to contract and arteries to narrow. By blocking the entry of calcium, calcium channel blocker (CCBs) decrease the contraction of the heart and dilate (widen) the arteries. By dilating the arteries, CCBs reduce the pressure in the arteries. This makes it easier for the heart to pump blood, and, as a result, the heart needs less oxygen. By reducing the heart's need for oxygen, CCBs prevent or relieve <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/angina_symptoms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">angina</a>. CCBs also are used for treating <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">high blood pressure</a> because of their blood pressure-lowering effects. CCBs also slow the rate at which the heart beats and are therefore used for treating certain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_rhythm_disorders/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abnormal heart rhythms</a> such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/atrial_fibrillation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">atrial fibrillation</a>. 
The most common side effects of CCBs are

When <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diltiazem/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">diltiazem</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/verapamil/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">verapamil</a> are
given to individuals with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart failure</a>, symptoms of heart failure may worsen
because these drugs reduce the ability of the heart to pump blood.
