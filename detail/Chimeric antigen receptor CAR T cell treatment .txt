The re-engineered cells are then re-introduced into the patient's bloodstream. This treatment has been used for people with B cell lymphomas that have relapsed or are refractory to treatment. It also is an approved treatment option for certain cases of leukemia. In 2018, the US FDA approved tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leukemia_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">acute lymphoblastic leukemia</a> (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse.
