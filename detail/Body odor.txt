Body odor: An unpleasant smell produced after perspiration. Body odor 
occurs when sweat contacts bacteria that normally reside on the skin. Sweat 
itself is almost odorless, but the combination of sweat with skin bacteria can 
produce an offensive odor. Good hygiene and antiperspirant or deodorant products 
can be used to manage the condition. In some unusually severe cases, 
prescription strength deodorants or antiperspirants may be required. Also known 
as "B.O."
