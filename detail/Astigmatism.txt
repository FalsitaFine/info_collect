Astigmatism: A common form of visual impairment in which part of an image is blurred due to an irregularity in the dome-shaped curvature of the front surface of the eye, the cornea. With <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/astigmatism_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">astigmatism</a>, light rays entering the eye are not uniformly focused on the retina. The result is blurred vision at all distances. Significant astigmatism can cause headaches, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_strain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">eye strain</a>, and seriously blurred vision. Astigmatism is often not detected during routine eye screening in schools. It may coexist with other refractive errors such as nearsightedness and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/farsightedness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">farsightedness</a>. Astigmatism is corrected with slightly cylindrical lenses that have greater light-bending power in one direction than the other. Use of these lenses elongates objects in one direction and shortens them in the other, much like looking into a distorting wavy mirror.
