Biofeedback: A method of treatment that uses a monitor to measure patients' physiologic information of which they are normally unaware. By watching a monitor, patients can learn by trial and error to adjust their thinking and other mental processes in order to control 'involuntary' bodily processes such as blood pressure, temperature, gastrointestinal functioning, and brain wave activity. Biofeedback is now used to treat a wide variety of conditions and diseases, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a>, alcohol and other addictions, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a> disorders, epilepsy, respiratory problems, fecal and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_incontinence/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">urinary incontinence</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_spasms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">muscle spasms</a>, partial paralysis, muscle dysfunction caused by injury, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">migraine</a> headaches, hypertension, and a variety of blood vessel conditions, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/raynauds_phenomenon/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Raynaud's phenomenon</a>.
