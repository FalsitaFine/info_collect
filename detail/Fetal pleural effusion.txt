Fetal pleural effusion: In the fetus, excess fluid between the two membranes (the pleurae) that envelop the lungs. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pleural_effusion_fluid_in_the_chest_or_on_lung/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pleural effusion</a> may be unilateral (in one lung) or bilateral (in both lungs) and it may be an isolated finding in an otherwise normal fetus or be associated with generalized <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">edema</a> (hydrops). If untreated, fetal pleural effusion often causes severe, sometimes fatal, respiratory insufficiency in the neonatal period. Treatment is by the prenatal insertion of a thoracoamniotic shunt (to shunt the pleural effusion into the amniotic fluid). Survival after this procedure is over 90% in fetuses with isolated pleural effusion and about 50% in those with associated hydrops.
