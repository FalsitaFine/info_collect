Ehrlichiosis: An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2133">acute</a> (abrupt onset)
disease, first reported in humans in 1986, due to infection by the 
rickettsial agent, Ehrlichia canis. The brown dog tick, is the common 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5968">vector</a> (carrier). 
Ehrlichiosis is clinically similar to Rocky Mountain spotted fever 
with high fever, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11396">headache</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4253">malaise</a>, and muscle pain but without a  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm">rash</a>.
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6463">Laboratory</a> features include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4149">leukopenia</a> (low <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9983">white blood cell count</a>), thrombocytopenia (low <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9939">platelet count</a>), mild <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15491">anemia</a>, and elevation in the levels of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3704">hepatic</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6591">aminotransferase</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15392">enzymes</a>. 

Clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities respond promptly to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10897">therapy</a> with the antibiotics tetracycline or doxycycline, and the majority of patients become afebrile within 24 to 48 hours after the start of such treatment. 

The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2979">diagnosis</a> of ehrlichiosis rests on the detection of ehrlichia either by direct means or by the indirect means of serologic studies. Three methods are available for detection: inspection of peripheral-blood smears, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.comhttps://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm7">PCR</a> testing, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5800">tissue</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2879">culture</a>. 
 
The disease ehrlichiosis is named for the great German Nobel Prize 
winning <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4887">physician</a> and bacteriologist Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915).
