Eyelids, congenital ptosis of the:  Drooping of 
the upper eyelids at birth.
The lids may droop only slightly or they may cover the 
pupils and restrict
or even block  vision.  Moderate or severe pstosis calls 
for treatment to
permit normal vision development. If not corrected, 
amblyopia ("lazy eye")
may develop which can lead to permanently poor vision. 
Ptosis at birth is
often caused by poor development of the levator muscle 
which lifts the
eyelid. Children with ptosis may tip their heads back into 
a chin-up
position to see underneath the eyelids or raise their 
eyebrows in an attempt
to lift up the lids. Congenital ptosis rarely improves with 
time.  Mild or
moderate ptosis usually does not require surgery early in 
life. Treatment is
usually surgery
to tighten the eyelid-lifting muscles, the levators. If the 
levator is very
weak, the lid can be attached or suspended from under the 
eyebrow so that
the forehead muscles can do the lifting. Even after 
surgery, focusing
problems can develop as the eyes grow and change shape. All 
children with
ptosis, whether they have had surgery or not, should 
therefore be followed
by an ophthalmologist.
