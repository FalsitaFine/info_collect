Modafinil: An oral drug first approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/narcolepsy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">narcolepsy</a>, a condition in which there is an uncontrollable desire to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/modafinil/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Modafinil</a> promotes wakefulness. In 2004 the FDA also approved modafinil for the treatment of obstructive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep_apnea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep apnea</a> and sleeping problems caused by shift work. Modafinil is said to be in common "off-label" use by college students, truckers, and others who want to stay awake when normally they should be sleeping. The drug is reportedly also being prescribed for numerous other problems including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">multiple sclerosis</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_in_children/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ADHD</a> (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Some of these "off-label" uses may prove legitimate while others may be abuses of the drug. Modafil stimulates the brain without producing the jitteriness of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">caffeine</a> or the addiction and euphoria of amphetamines. Modafinil is believed to act by affecting dopamine and other neurotransmitters including histamine and norepinephrine.  It is sold under the brand name Provigil.
