Chromatophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of money. Sufferers experience undue <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a> even though they realize their fear is irrational. They worry that they might mismanage money or that money might live up to its reputation as "the root of all evil."  Perhaps they remember well the ill fortune that befell the mythical King Midas.

"Chromatophobia" is derived from the Greek "chrimata" (money) and "phobos" (fear). The "chrome" in
"chromatophobia" may also be related to the Greek word "chroma" (color) because of the brilliant colors of ancient coins--for example, gold, silver, bronze and copper.
