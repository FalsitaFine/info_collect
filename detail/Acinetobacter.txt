Acinetobacter: (Pronounced AH-sin-neto-bacter). A group of bacteria found in soil, water, and hospitals where they can cause serious infections in immunocompromised people and are often resistant to antibiotics. Acinetobacter can be isolated from many sources including drinking and surface water, soil, sewage and different types of foods. At least a quarter of healthy people carry Acinetobacter harmlessly on their skin. But in hospitals some strains, particularly <i>Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii)</i>, can cause infections including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pneumonia</a> and bacteremia (bloodstream infection). In technical terms, the Acinetobacter genus belongs to the gamma subdivision of Proteobacteria, and to the Moraxellaceae family.
