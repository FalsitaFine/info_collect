Measles immunization: The standard MMR 
vaccine is given 
to prevent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/measles_rubeola/article.htm">measles</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mumps/article.htm">mumps</a> and rubella (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/german_measles/article.htm">German measles</a>). The MMR 
vaccine is now given in
two dosages. The first should be given at 12-15 months of age. The 
second vaccination should be given at 4-6 years. Most children
should receive MMR vaccinations. Exceptions may include children born 
with an inability to
fight off infection, some children with cancer, on treatment with 
radiation or drugs for
cancer, on long term steroids (cortisone). People with severe 
allergic reactions to eggs
or the drug neomycin should probably avoid the MMR vaccine. Pregnant 
women should wait
until after delivery before being immunized with MMR. People with HIV 
or AIDS should
normally receive MMR vaccine. Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines 
may be administered as
individual shots, if necessary, or as a measles-rubella combination.
