The virus responsible for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/monkeypox/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">monkeypox</a> is, in fact, related to that responsible for smallpox. Both belong to the orthopox family of viruses. Vaccination against smallpox gives protection against monkeypox. Before the eradication of smallpox, vaccination was widely practiced and protected against both diseases.

The death rate from monkeypox is highest in young children, reaching about 10%.
