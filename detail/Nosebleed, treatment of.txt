The person should hold the nose for at least 5 minutes and repeat as necessary until the nose has stopped bleeding, sitting quietly and keeping the head higher than the level of the heart (sitting up or lying with the head elevated). The person may also apply ice (crushed, in a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">plastic</a> bag or washcloth) to the nose and cheeks.
