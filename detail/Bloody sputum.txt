Bloody sputum can be caused by infection in the lungs and airways, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bronchitis_acute/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">acute bronchitis</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pneumonia</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>. Whenever bloody sputum is present and cannot be attributed to a curable infectious condition, a complete lung evaluation is warranted, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bronchoscopy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">bronchoscopy</a>, to be certain cancer is not present.
