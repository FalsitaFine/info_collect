Medifast diet: The Medifast diet is a low-fat, low-calorie <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a> plan based upon the consumption of specific foods and beverages developed and sold by the Medifast company. The diet plan includes shakes, bars, puddings, soups, oatmeal, hot cocoa, and cappucino. Medifast products contain an appetite suppressor ("Super Citrimax") that is derived from the southeast Asian plant known as <i>Garcinia Cambogia.</i> The diet consists of eating the formulated foods plus one "lean and green" (low-fat meats plus vegetables) meal per day. The Medifast diet claims that adherence to the diet can result in weight loss of 2-5 pounds per week. Medifast recommends consultation with a physician before beginning the program. Like all low-calorie diets, the plan is safest when followed under the supervision of a physician.
