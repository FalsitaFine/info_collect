Mononeuropathy: A disorder of a single nerve or nerve trunk. Mononeuropathies may be due to entrapment, compression, stretch injury, ischemia, infection, or inflammation of a nerve. The most common entrapments are of the median nerve of the wrist (the carpal tunnel syndrome) and ulnar nerve of the elbow (the cubital tunnel syndrome). In the lower extremities, common nerve entrapments are of the peroneal nerve (peroneal neuropathy) and the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/meralgia_paresthetica/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">meralgia paresthetica</a>).
