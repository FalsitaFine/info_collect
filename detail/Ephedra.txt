Ephedra: A medicinal herb, known scientifically as Ephedra sinica and Ephedra equisetina, also known as mahuang and herbal ecstasy. Ephedra comes from the dried rhizome and root of the plant.

Both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are central nervous system stimulants that act as decongestants but, in high doses, can raise the blood pressure.

Ephedra represented about 5% of all diet supplements sold but about 45% of the adverse events associated with diet supplements in the US.
The US Food and Drug Administration first issued warnings against the consumption of dietary supplements that contain ephedra. Then, after the death on Feb. 17, 2003 of a young baseball pitcher who had used ephedra, the FDA proposed labels warning consumers that ephedra had been linked to heart problems and strokes. And, finally, on Dec. 30, 2003 the FDA banned ephedra from the marketplace because of the health risks it posed.
