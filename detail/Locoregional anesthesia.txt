Locoregional anesthesia: Anesthesia that eliminates pain only in the region of the surgery. This may be done by a "spinal" in which an anesthetic agent is administered by lumbar injection. Locoregional anesthesia is in contrast to general anesthesia on the one hand and local anesthesia on the other.
