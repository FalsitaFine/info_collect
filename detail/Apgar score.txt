Apgar score: An objective score of the condition of a baby after birth. This score is determined by scoring the heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, skin color, and response to a catheter in the nostril. Each of these objective signs receives 0, 1, or 2 points. An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/apgar_score/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Apgar score</a> of 10 means an infant is in the best possible condition. The Apgar score is done routinely 60 seconds after the birth of the infant. A child with a score of 0 to 3 needs immediate resuscitation. The Apgar score is often repeated 5 minutes after birth, and in the event of a difficult resuscitation, the Apgar score may be done again at 10, 15, and 20 minutes.
