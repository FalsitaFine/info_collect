Arctic health: Health in the vast geographic region widely surrounding the North Pole, an area that encompasses all or portions of Alaska, Canada, Greenland/Denmark/Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. The populations of these countries, including their indigenous inhabitants such as the Aleut, Inuit, and Saami, have to cope with extreme climatic conditions and are subject to a unique set of health and environmental challenges. The word "arctic" is derived from "arktos," the Greek word for bear.
