Integrin: One of a large and very important family of adhesion molecules that promote stable interactions between cells and their environment. The integrins also act as cellular sensor and signaling molecules. Integrins contain two types of subunits called alpha and beta. All of the alpha subunits have some similarity to each other, as do all of the beta subunits.
