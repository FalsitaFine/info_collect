Conotoxin: A toxin made by cone snails (Conidae), also called cone shells, which are fish-eating snails that inhabit tropical coral reefs, mangroves and associated habitats. Each of the 500 species of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=24865" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cone snail</a> produces roughly 50 to 100 distinct conotoxins which they use to immobilize prey. These toxins are selective in their receptor binding sites. Conotoxins have been used to characterize receptors in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9658" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">heart muscle</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5502" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">skeletal muscle</a> and brain. Calcium, potassium, and sodium ion channels have also been characterized using conotoxins.
