MEF2A: A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25194" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">transcription factor</a> that participates in vascular development. MEF2A is a member of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4357" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Messenger RNA</a> (mRNA) from MEF2A has been detected in blood vessels during early embryogenesis. The gene for MEF2A is located on chromosome 15q26. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3719" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">heritable</a> deletion within the MEF2A gene that results in the loss of 7 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=39555" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">amino acids</a> appears responsible for an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11974" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">autosomal dominant</a> form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10267" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">coronary artery disease</a>. The deletion alters the cellular distribution of the MEF2A protein and may prevent its function as a vascular transcription factor. It remains to be seen if the MEF2A pathway plays a role in the common form of coronary artery disease resulting from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15018" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">atherosclerosis</a>. MEF2A is also known as MADS box transcription enhancer factor 2, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7766" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">polypeptide</a> A.
