Hybridization, in situ: The use of a DNA or RNA <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5052" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">probe</a> to
detect the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2807" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">complementary sequence</a>.
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3988" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">In situ hybridization</a> is like all <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=14349" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">nucleic acid hybridization</a> in being a technique in which single-stranded <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15378" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">nucleic acids</a> (DNA or RNA) are permitted to interact so that complexes, or hybrids, are formed by molecules with sufficiently similar, complementary sequences. Through <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4594" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">nucleic acid</a> hybridization, the degree of sequence identity can be determined and specific sequences detected and sometimes those sequences can be located on a specific chromosome. In situ hybridization is done for this purpose. It involves hybridizing a labelled nucleic acid (often labelled with a fluorescent dye) to suitably prepared cells or histological sections. This is used particularly to look for specific transcription or localization of genes to specific chromosomes (via <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3486" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">fluorescent in situ hybridization</a>, or FISH analysis).
