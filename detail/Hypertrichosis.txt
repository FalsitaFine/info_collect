Hypertrichosis has also been referred to as Ambras Syndrome and informally as Werewolf syndrome. The degree of severity can vary among affected persons. The excess hair may be present in one area of the body or all over the body and may be fine or thick, short or long. It is sometimes associated with other abnormalities. The condition can be either present at birth (congenital) or may develop later in life (acquired).
