False rib: One of the last five pairs of ribs. A rib is said to be false if it does not attach to the sternum (the breastbone). The upper three false ribs connect to the costal cartilages of the ribs just above them. The last two false ribs usually have no ventral attachment to anchor them in front and so are called floating, fluctuating, or vertebral ribs.
