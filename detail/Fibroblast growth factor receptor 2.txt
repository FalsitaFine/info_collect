Fibroblast growth factor receptor 
2: A mutation (change) in 
the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6497">FGFR2</a>) gene on 
chromosome 10 
causes the best-known type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6574">acrocephalosyndactyly</a>, namely 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6575"> Apert syndrome</a> which is 
characterized by abnormalities of the skull and face and the hands and feet.  There is  
premature closure of some of the sutures of the skull 
(<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=20866">craniosynostosis</a>) 
resulting in an abnormally shaped head (which is unusually tall but short from 
front-to-back) and an abnormally shaped face with shallow eye sockets and 
underdevelopment of the midface. There is fusion of fingers 
and toes (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6698">syndactyly</a>) and broad 
ends of the thumbs and big toes. Surgery is often useful with the skull, face, 
hands and feet. Different mutations in FGFR2 are responsible for two other 
genetic diseases, namely, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11879">Pfeiffer syndrome</a> 
(another type of acrocephalosyndactyly) and Crouzon syndrome (purely a 
craniofacial disorder with no hand or foot problems). All are inherited as 
dominant traits.
