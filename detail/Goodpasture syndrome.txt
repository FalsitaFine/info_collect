Goodpasture syndrome: An autoimmune disease characterized by a combination of lung and kidney disease. Hallmarks of the disease are pulmonary hemorrhage (bleeding in the lungs) and glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomerulus) due to severe inflammation in the basement membranes of the alveolus of the lung and the glomerulus in the kidney, with the formation of antibodies to components of the basement membrane at both sites. Symptoms include cough with bloody sputum, bloody urine, decreased urine output, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a> (weakness), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a>.

The syndrome is also referred to as anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease.
