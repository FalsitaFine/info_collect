In China, for example, ginger has been used to help digestion and treat stomach upset, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a>, and nausea for more than 2,000 years. Today, health care professionals may recommend ginger to help prevent or treat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nausea and vomiting</a> from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/motion_sickness_sea_sickness_car_sickness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">motion sickness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chemotherapy</a>. It is also used as a digestive aid for mild stomach upset, to reduce pain of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoarthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">osteoarthritis</a>, and may even be used in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart disease</a> or cancer.    Ginger may lead to blood thinning. It is therefore best not taken with medications that prevent blood clotting (anticoagulants) such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">warfarin</a> (Coumadin).
