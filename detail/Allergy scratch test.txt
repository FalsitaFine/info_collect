Allergy scratch test: A test in which a small drop of the suspected <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergy</a>-provoking substance (allergen) is placed on the skin and the skin is then gently scratched through the drop with a sterile needle. If the skin reddens and, more importantly, if it swells, the test is read as positive, and allergy to that substance is considered probable.
