Hepatic duct: A duct that carries bile from the liver into the common bile duct which conveys it to the duodenum (the upper part of the small intestine). There are three hepatic ducts: the right hepatic duct (which drains bile from the right half of the liver); the left hepatic duct (which drains bile from the left half of the liver); and the common hepatic duct (which is formed by the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts).
