Drosophila genome: All of the genetic information contained in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=26697" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Drosophila</a>, the fruit fly.  The genomes of particular nonhuman organisms such as Drosophila have been studied for a number of reasons including the need to improve <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5465" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">sequencing</a> and analysis techniques. These nonhuman genomes also provide powerful sets of data against which to compare the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3818" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">human genome</a>.  The fruit fly's genes are similar to those of people. Of the (3382) genes known to cause human disease in mutated form (as of Feb 2012), 75% have been found to have counterparts in the fly. Fathoming fly genes is therefore a step toward knowledge and, hopefully, the treatment of human genetic diseases.
