Factor X: A coagulation factor, a substance in blood essential to the normal clotting process. Production of factor X takes place in the liver and requires vitamin K. The gene for factor X is located on chromosome 13 and is in band 13q34.   The "X" in factor X is the Roman numeral "ten." (All numbered coagulation factors bear Roman numerals.) Factor X became known because of a genetic condition in which the factor is lacking.  Factor X deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait manifest by prolonged nose bleeds, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, menorrhagia (abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding), hematuria (blood in the urine), and hemarthrosis (bleeding into joints). <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Pregnancy</a> in women with factor X deficiency is often associated with adverse fetal outcomes  (recurrent spontaneous abortion, placental abruption, and premature birth).
