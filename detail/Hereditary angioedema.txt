Hereditary angioedema: A genetic form of angioedema.
(Angioedema is also referred to as Quinke's disease.) Persons with it are born
lacking an inhibitor protein (called C1 esterase inhibitor) that normally prevents
activation of a cascade of proteins leading to the swelling of angioedema. Patients can
develop recurrent attacks of swollen tissues, pain in the abdomen, and swelling of the
voice box (larynx) which can compromise breathing. The diagnosis is suspected with a
history of recurrent angioedema. It is confirmed by finding abnormally low levels of C1
esterase inhibitor in the blood. Treatment options include antihistamines and male
steroids (androgens) that can also prevent the recurrent attacks. Also called hereditary
angioneurotic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">edema</a>.
