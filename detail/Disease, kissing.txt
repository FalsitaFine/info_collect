Disease, kissing: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infectious_mononucleosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Infectious mononucleosis</a> ("mono"), a very common illness caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). By the
time most people reach adulthood, an antibody against EBV can be detected in their blood
meaning they have been infected with EBV. The illness is less severe in young children.
The infection can be spread by saliva. Hence, the name: the kissing disease. The
incubation period for "mono" is 4 to 8 weeks. Symptoms include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a>,
