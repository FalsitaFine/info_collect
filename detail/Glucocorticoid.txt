Glucocorticoid: A hormone that predominantly affects
the metabolism of carbohydrates and, to a lesser extent, fats and proteins (and has other
effects). Glucocorticoids are made in the outside portion (the cortex) of the adrenal
gland and chemically classed as steroids. Cortisol is the major natural glucocorticoid.
The term glucocorticoid also applies to equivalent hormones synthesized in the laboratory.
