Guanine: One of the four bases in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3090">DNA</a> that make up the letters ATGC. Guanine is the "G". The others are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2143">adenine</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2908">cytosine</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5774">thymine</a>. Guanine always pairs with cytosine to form the base pair G-C (guanine-cytosine) in the DNA. The other base pair in the DNA is A-T (adenine-thymine). Each base pair forms a rung in the DNA ladder. Guanine is also one of the four bases in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5382">RNA</a>.
