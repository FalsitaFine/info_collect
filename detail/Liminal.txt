Liminal: In neurolgy, at the threshold of perception to a sensory stimulus. In other words, just barely perceptible to the senses.

"Liminal" comes from the Latin noun "limen" meaning
"threshold." It makes sense, then, that "liminal" applies to
the idea of a sensory threshold. "Subliminal" is below that threshold at which an effect is produced.
