CCD (Central core disease of muscle): One of the
conditions that produces 'floppy baby' syndrome. CCD causes hypotonia
(floppiness) in the newborn baby, slowly progressive muscle weakness, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_cramps/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">muscle cramps</a> after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a>.
