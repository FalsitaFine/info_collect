Fine needle aspiration: The use of a thin needle to withdraw material from the body for analysis. For example, when a nodule is felt in the thyroid, fine needle aspiration may be done to remove a tissue sample that can be examined to determine whether the nodule is benign or malignant. The aspirated material is examined under the microscope by a pathologist.
