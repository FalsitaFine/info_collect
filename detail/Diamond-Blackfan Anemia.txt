Diamond-Blackfan anemia: A genetic condition affecting the bone marrow that leads to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anemia</a> (low numbers of red blood cells) and often, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_defects/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">birth defects</a>. It affects 
five to 10 out of every million babies born in the U.S. A number of genetic mutations have been identified that can cause Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that only one copy of the defective gene is needed to cause the disorder. In about 45% of cases, those affected inherit a defective gene from one parent. In the remaining cases, a new mutation (change in the gene) occurs in people who do not have the condition in their family.
