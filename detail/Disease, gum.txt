Disease, gum: Infection of the soft tissue (gingiva) and abnormal loss of bone that surrounds the teeth and holds them in place. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gum_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Gum disease</a> is  caused by toxins secreted by bacteria in "plaque" that accumulate over time  along the gum line. This plaque is a mixture of food, saliva, and bacteria. Early symptoms  of gum disease include gum bleeding without pain. Pain is a symptom of more advanced gum  disease as the loss of bone around the teeth leads to the formation of gum pockets.  Bacteria in these pockets cause gum infection, swelling, pain, and further bone  destruction. Advanced gum disease can cause loss of otherwise healthy teeth.
