Kyphoplasty: A procedure similar to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7981">vertebroplasty</a>, but with the intent of expanding the collapsed<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5986">vertebra</a>. A surgical instrument is introduced into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5529">spine</a> with a balloon that is inflated to expand the bone. Once this instrument is withdrawn, the space created is then filled with the bone cement mixture. By creating space in this way, kyphoplasty procedures may correct deformity or restore body height. 
Like vertebroplasty, the use of kyphoplasty to treat osteoporotic compression fractures in patients where conservative treatment has failed is relatively recent.
