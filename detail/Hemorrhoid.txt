The symptoms start with bleeding after defecation. If untreated, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemorrhoids_piles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hemorrhoids</a> can worsen, protruding from the anus. In their worst stage, they must be returned to the anal cavity manually. Fissures can develop, and these may cause intense discomfort. Treatment is by changing the diet to prevent constipation and avoid further irritation, the use of topical medication, and sometimes surgery or sclerotherapy.  Also known as piles.
