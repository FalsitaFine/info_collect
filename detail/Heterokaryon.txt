Heterokaryon: A cell with two separate nuclei formed by the experimental fusion of two genetically different cells. For example, heterokaryons composed of nuclei from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3821" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Hurler syndrome</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=21020" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Hunter syndrome</a>, both diseases of mucopolysaccharide metabolism, have normal mucopolysaccharide metabolism. This proves that the two syndromes affect different proteins and so can correct each other in the heterokaryon.
