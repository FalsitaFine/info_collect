Disease, Legionnaire: A disease due to the bacteria <u><i>Legionella pneumophila</i></u> found in plumbing, shower heads, water-storage tanks and air cooling systems. Outbreaks of Legionella <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pneumonia</a> have been attributed to evaporative condensers and cooling towers. The bacteria thrives in the mist sprayed from air-conditioning ducts and so it can infest an entire building or airplane. Travelers are especially vulnerable in the closed space within a plane.  Legionnaire disease can cause a massive pneumonia associated with collapse of the respiratory function. It can be an overwhelming and sometimes fatal illness. The disease was first identified as a sequel of the 1976 convention of the American Legion in some of those who had attended the convention. It was therefore named Legionnaire disease.
