Familial eosinophilia: An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11974" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">autosomal dominant</a> condition characterized by an abnormally high level of eosinophils in the blood. Despite the prolonged <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33429" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">eosinophilia</a>, there may be no symptoms. The gene for familial eosinophilia, called EOS, has been mapped to chromosome region 5q31-33 containing the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11937" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cytokine</a> gene cluster which includes the genes for interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-5 (IL-5), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=31266" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">granulocyte colony-stimulating factor</a> (G-CSF),  and all of which are thought play roles in the development, proliferation, and activation of eosinophils.
