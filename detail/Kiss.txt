Kiss: A touch or caress with the lips. "The anatomical juxtaposition of two orbicularis oris muscles in a state of contraction." -- Henry Gibbons, Sr., MD (1808-1884)   (This definition does not apply universally as a kiss can also refer to the single application of one's lips against anything else.)
