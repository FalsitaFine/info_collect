Hershey-Chase experiment: An extraordinarily important experiment in 1952 that helped to convince the world that DNA was the genetic material. Alfred Hershey (1908-1997) and his assistant Martha Chase (1923-2003) at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory showed that the DNA, not the protein, of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4855" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">phage</a> virus contains the phage genes. After a phage particle attaches to a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2416" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">bacterium</a>, its DNA enters through a tiny hole while its protein coat remains outside. Key to the success of the experiment was showing that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11557" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">viral infection</a> was unaffected by violent agitation in a kitchen blender (a Waring Blendor) which removed the empty viral protein shells from the bacterial surface. The Hershey-Chase experiment became known as the "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=39045" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">blender experiment</a>." Alfred D. Hershey won a Nobel Prize for his insights into the nature of viruses in 1969, along with Max Delbruck and Salvador Luria.
In a 1997 memoriam to Hersey, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32830" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">James Watson</a> wrote that "the Hershey-Chase experiment had a much broader impact than most confirmatory announcements and made me ever more certain that finding the three-dimensional structure of DNA was biology's next important objective. The finding of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3109" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">double helix</a> by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32828" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Francis Crick</a> and me came only 11 months after my receipt of a long Hershey letter describing his blender experiment results."
