Bedsore: A painful, often reddened area of degenerating, ulcerated skin that is caused by pressure and lack of movement and is worsened by exposure to urine or other irritating substances. Untreated bedsores can become seriously infected or gangrenous. Bedsores are a major problem for patients who are confined to a bed or wheelchair, and they can be prevented by moving the patient frequently, changing bedding, and keeping the skin clean and dry.
