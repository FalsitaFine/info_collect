Disease, Ritter: This is the scalded skin syndrome, a
potentially serious side effect of infection with the Staph (Staphylococcus) bacteria that
produces a specific protein which loosens the "cement" holding the various
layers of the skin together. This allows blister formation and sloughing of the top layer
of skin. If it occurs over large body regions it can be deadly (just like a large surface
area of the body having been burned). It is necessary to treat scalded skin syndrome with
intravenous antibiotics and to protect the skin from allowing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dehydration</a> to occur if
large areas peel off. The disease occurs predominantly in children under 5 years of age.
It is known formally as Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome.
