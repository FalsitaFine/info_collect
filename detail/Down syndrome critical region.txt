A number of genes in this region may be involved in the production of the Down syndrome phenotype.
These genes may include the Down syndrome critical region 1 gene or DSCR1 on chromosome 22q11.2; DSCR2 on chromosome 21q22.3; DSCR3 in chromosome 21q22.2; DSCR4 on chromosome 21q22.2; and DSCR5 in chromosome region 21q22.1-q22.2.
