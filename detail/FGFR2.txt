FGFR2:    A mutation (change) in 
the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene on 
chromosome 10 causes the best-known type of 
acrocephalosyndactyly, namely Apert syndrome which is 
characterized by abnormalities of the skull and face and 
the hands and feet.  There is premature closure of some of 
the sutures of the skull (craniosynostosis) resulting in an 
abnormally shaped head (which is unusually tall but short 
from front-to-back) and an abnormally shaped face with 
shallow eye sockets and underdevelopment of the midface. 
There is fusion of fingers and toes (syndactyly) and broad 
ends of the thumbs and big toes. Surgery is often useful 
with the skull, face, hands and feet.  Different mutations 
in FGFR2 are responsible for two other genetic diseases, 
namely, Pfeiffer syndrome (another type of 
acrocephalosyndactyly) and Crouzon syndrome (purely a 
craniofacial disorder with no hand or foot problems). All 
are inherited as dominant traits.
