Demyelination: A degenerative process that erodes 
away the myelin sheath that normally protects nerve fibers. 
Demyelination exposes these fibers and appears to cause 
problems in nerve impulse conduction that may affect many 
physical systems. Demyelinization is seen in a number of 
diseases, particularly <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms/article.htm">multiple sclerosis</a>. 

Diagnosis is by 
functional observation and by testing for myelin protein in 
the blood.
