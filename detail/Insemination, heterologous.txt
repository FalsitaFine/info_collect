Insemination, heterologous:  A procedure in which 
a fine catheter (tube) is
inserted through the cervix (the natural opening of the 
uterus) into the
uterus (the womb) to deposit a sperm sample from a donor 
other than the
woman's mate directly into the uterus. The purpose of this 
procedure is to
achieve fertilization and pregnancy. Also termed artificial 
insemination by
donor (AID). AID is distinguished from homologous 
insemination, that is
artificial insemination by husband (AIH).
