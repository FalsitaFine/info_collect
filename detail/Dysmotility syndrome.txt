Other terms that are sometimes used for dysmotility problems are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroparesis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gastroparesis</a> when the stomach is involved, and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction when the intestines and stomach are involved.
