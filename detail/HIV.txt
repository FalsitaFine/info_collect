HIV: Acronym for the 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm">Human Immunodeficiency Virus</a>, the cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2181">AIDS</a> (acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome). HIV has also been called the human 
lymphotropic virus type III, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6473">lymphadenopathy-associated virus</a> and 
the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6472">lymphadenopathy virus</a>. No matter 
what name is applied, it is a retrovirus. (A retrovirus has an RNA genome and a 
reverse transcriptase enzyme. Using the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5347">reverse transcriptase</a>, the virus uses its RNA as a template for making complementary 
DNA which can 
integrate into the DNA of the host organism). 
Although the American 
research Robert Gallo at the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9786">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH) 
believed he was the first to find HIV, it is now generally accepted that the 
French physician Luc Montagnier (1932-) and his team at the Pasteur 
Institute discovered HIV in 1983-84.
