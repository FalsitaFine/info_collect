Meningitis, meningococcal: Inflammation of the meninges due to infection with the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. Meningococcal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalitis_and_meningitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">meningitis</a> typically starts like the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">flu</a>, with the sudden onset of an intense <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sore throat</a>, nausea, vomiting, and malaise.

Within hours of the first symptoms, the disease can progress to delirium, coma, or convulsions and invade the bloodstream, setting off a bodywide infection that attacks organs and can cause circulatory collapse, a hemorrhagic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gangrene/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gangrene</a>. Meningococcal meningitis is a medical emergency. Diagnosis is made through examination of the CSF obtained via <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lumbar_puncture/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">lumbar puncture</a>. Treatment includes use of appropriate antibiotics, usually in the hospital. The disease is highly contagious; it is spread by contact with an affected individual's respiratory secretions, such as by coughing or kissing. Meningococcal meningitis has a high fatality rate if not recognized and treated properly. Vaccines against four types of meningococcal disease are available and are recommended for at-risk persons, including college freshmen living in dormitories.
