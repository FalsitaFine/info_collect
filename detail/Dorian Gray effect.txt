Named after "The Picture of Dorian Gray" (1890), the novel by Oscar Wilde, in which Dorian gives his soul to remain young while the painting of him grows old. Despite a life of dissipation and worse, Gray stays youthful in appearance. Instead, his portrait records his dissolute deeds, becoming a hideous mask. When Gray destroys the painting, his face turns into a replica of the portrait.
