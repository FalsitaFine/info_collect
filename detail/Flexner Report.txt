Flexner Report: A report, the full name of which is 'Medical Education in the United States and Canada.' The 1910 report is named for its author, professional educator Abraham Flexner, who researched and wrote this report for the Carnegie Foundation. At the time that the report was written, many medical schools were proprietary schools operated more for profit than for education. In their stead, Flexner proposed medical schools in the German tradition of strong biomedical sciences, together with hands-on clinical training. The Flexner Report caused many medical schools to close, and most of the remaining schools were reformed to conform to the Flexnerian model.
