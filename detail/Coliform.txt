<i>Eschericia coli</i> (<i><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli__0157h7/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">E. coli</a></i>) is an example of the coliform bacteria. Coliforms are found in water, in soil, and on plants. They are common in the feces of all warm-blooded animals. Testing for coliform bacteria is commonly done to determine the quality of water supplies. While coliform bacteria themselves are not likely to cause illness, their presence in water supplies indicates that other disease-causing bacteria or organisms are present in the water supply.
