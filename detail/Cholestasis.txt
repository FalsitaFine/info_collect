Cholestasis: a decrease or blockage in the flow of bile. Bile is a fluid produced by the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a> that travels through ducts to enter the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">digestive system</a> in the small intestine. Diseases of the liver, pancreas, or of the bile ducts themselves can all cause cholestasis. Symptoms of cholestasis include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/jaundice_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">jaundice</a> (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes look yellow), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dark_urine/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">dark urine</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itching</a>, and light-colored <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_changes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stool</a>.
