Fetishism: Fetishism is a problem in which a person has <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sexual_sex_problems_in_men/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sexual</a> urges associated with non-living objects. The person becomes sexually aroused by wearing or touching the object. For example, the object of a fetish could be an article of clothing, such as underwear, rubber clothing, women's shoes, or women's underwear or lingerie. The fetish may replace sexual activity with a partner or may be integrated into sexual activity with a willing partner. When the fetish becomes the sole object of sexual desire, sexual relationships often are avoided. A related disorder, called partialism, involves becoming sexually aroused by a body part, such as the feet, breasts or buttocks.
