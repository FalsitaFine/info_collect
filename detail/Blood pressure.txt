Blood pressure: The blood pressure is the pressure of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2483">blood</a> within the arteries. It is produced primarily by the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2834">contraction</a> of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9658">heart muscle</a>. It's
measurement is recorded by two numbers. The first (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=16163">systolic</a> pressure) is measured after
the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3668">heart</a> contracts and is highest. The second (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=16164">diastolic</a> pressure) is measured before the
heart contracts and lowest. A blood pressure cuff is used to measure the pressure.
