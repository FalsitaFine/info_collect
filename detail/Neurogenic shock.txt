Neurogenic shock: A type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shock/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">shock</a> (a life-threatening medical condition in which there is insufficient blood flow throughout the body) that is caused by the sudden loss of signals from the sympathetic nervous system that maintain the normal muscle tone in blood vessel walls. The blood vessels relax and become dilated, resulting in pooling of the blood in the venous system and an overall decrease in blood pressure. Neurogenic shock can be a complication of injury to the brain or spinal cord.
