Patients may be free of attacks for months or even years. This disorder is considered an autoinflammatory disease.

This is also known as Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome. The key laboratory abnormality is a continuously high level of IgD (immunoglobulin D). By "high" is meant more than 100 IU (International Units) per milliliter of blood. Over 80% of patients also have high IgA (immunoglobulin A) levels.

The syndrome is an autosomal recessive trait. The gene for the syndrome is on chromosome 12. It encodes the enzyme mevalonate kinase. Most patients are compound heterozygotes with two different mutations in the gene for mevalonate kinase, one mutation inherited from one parent, and the other mutation from the other parent.
