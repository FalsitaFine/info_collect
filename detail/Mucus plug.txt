Mucus plug: An accumulation of mucus and thick fluid that blocks the 
opening of the cervix (the opening from the uterus to the vagina) during 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm">pregnancy</a>. The mucus plug serves to protect the uterus and the fetus by 
preventing bacteria from entering the uterus. The mucus plus can be clear or 
slightly pink in color and can be tinged with brown or red blood. As the cervix 
slowly begins to dilate prior to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/labor_and_delivery/article.htm">onset of labor</a>, the mucus plug is expelled. 
When expelled, the mucus plug has been referred to as "bloody show." When the 
mucus plug is expelled, it may be noticed by the woman as a solid mass or as 
increased <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_discharge/symptoms.htm">vaginal discharge</a> over a few days. Sometimes the woman may not notice 
passage of the mucus plug since it can occur gradually. Also spelled mucous 
plug.
