Bright's disease: Chronic inflammation of the blood vessels in the kidney with protein, specifically albumin, in the urine. There are a number of disorders that lead to Bright's disease. With nothing more sophisticated than a candle and a silver spoon, the English physician Richard Bright (1789-1858) discovered protein in urine and in 1827 published his pioneering study of kidney disease.
