During <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a> measles may trigger miscarriages or premature delivery. Measles can be prevented through vaccination. The disease is also called the hard measles and (depending on how long you think it lasts) the seven-day measles, the eight-day measles, or the ten-day measles, and morbilli. The name measles comes from the Middle English maselen meaning many little spots referring, of course, to the rash.
