Irradiation: The use of high-energy radiation from x-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, and other sources to kill <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> cells and shrink tumors. Radiation may come from a machine outside the body (external-beam <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">radiation therapy</a>) or from materials called radioisotopes. Radioisotopes produce radiation and can be placed in or near the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> or in the area near cancer cells. This type of radiation treatment is called internal radiation therapy, implant radiation, interstitial radiation, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brachytherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">brachytherapy</a>. Systemic radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance, such as a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody, that circulates throughout the body. Irradiation is also called radiation therapy, radiotherapy, and x-ray therapy.
