Gingivitis, Vincent: This is trench mouth, a progressive painful infection with ulceration, swelling   and sloughing off of dead tissue from the gums due to infection. Certain germs (including fusiform bacteria and spirochetes) have been thought to be involved, but the full story behind this long-known disease is still not clear.   This condition is also called Vincent's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/angina_symptoms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">angina</a> after the French physician Henri Vincent (1862-1950). The word "angina" comes from the Latin "angere" meaning "to choke or throttle."  Treatment includes removal of plaque and tarter from the teeth.  In some cases, mouth rinses and antibiotics are also used.   As with most poorly understood diseases, Vincent gingivitis goes by many other names including acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), acute membranous gingivitis, fusospirillary gingivitis, fusospirillosis, fusospirochetal gingivitis,  necrotizing gingivitis, phagedenic gingivitis, ulcerative gingivitis, Vincent angina, Vincent infection, and Vincent stomatitis.
