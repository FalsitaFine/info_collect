Aorta: The largest artery in the body, the aorta 
arises from the left ventricle of the heart, goes up (ascends) a 
little ways, bends over (arches), then goes down (descends) through 
the chest and through the abdomen to where ends by dividing into two 
arteries called the common iliac arteries that go to the legs.
Anatomically, the aorta is traditionally divided into the 
ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the descending aorta. The 
descending aorta is, in turn, subdivided into the thoracic aorta 
(that descends within the chest) and the abdominal aorta (that 
descends within the belly). 
The aorta gives off branches that go to the head and neck, the 
arms, the major organs in the chest and abdomen, and the legs. It 
serves to supply them all with oxygenated blood. The aorta is 
the central conduit from the heart to the body.
