Cryostat: A chamber that can maintain very low   temperatures. Medical laboratories use a cryostat to preserve frozen   tissue samples while a microtome, an extremely sharp cutting   instrument mounted inside cryostats, slices the tissue into pieces   thin enough to be observed under a microscope. The sliced piece must   be so thin as to look nearly transparent. A pathologist, a laboratory   doctor trained to identify evidence of disease in microscopic   structures, then examines the slice to confirm or rule out the   presence of a disease, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>. Use of frozen tissue samples   enables physicians to examine tissue and diagnose its condition more   quickly than if the tissue had been preserved without freezing.   Microtomes may be used alone, without cryostats, to yield thin   microscopic samples.  "Cryostat" is derived from the Greek "kryos" (cold) and "statos"   (standing, stationary, like the cryostat chamber). "Kryos" gives us   many English words, such as "cryonics" (use of coldness in medicine   to bring about beneficial results) and "cryosurgery" (use of below-  freezing temperatures to destroy disease). "Statos" and related Greek   words give us such English words as "static" and "stationary."
