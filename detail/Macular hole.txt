Macular hole: A hole in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4241">macula</a>, the tiny oval area made up of millions of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4537">nerve</a> cells located at the center of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7931">retina</a> responsible for sharp, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8544">central vision</a>. 
The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7021">eye</a> contains a jelly-like substance called the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7983">vitreous</a>. Shrinking of the vitreous usually causes the hole. As a person ages, the vitreous becomes thicker and stringier and begins to pull away from the retina. If the vitreous is firmly attached to the retina when it pulls away, a hole can result.
The size of the hole and its location on the retina determine how much it affects vision. Generally, people notice a slight distortion or reduction in their eyesight. However, if the hole goes all the way through the macula, you can lose a lot of your central vision and therefore your detailed fine vision.
