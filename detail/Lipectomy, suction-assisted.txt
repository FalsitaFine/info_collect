Lipectomy, suction-assisted:  Another name for 
liposuction,  the surgical removal of fat deposits from 
specific parts of the body, the most common being
the abdomen (the "tummy"), buttocks ("behind"), hips, 
thighs and knees, chin, upper arms, back, and calves. The 
technique breaks up and "sucks" fat out of the body through 
a canula (a hollow instrument) inserted subdermally
(under the skin) thanks to a strong high-pressure vacuum 
that is applied to the cannula. In ultrasonic assisted 
liposuction (UAL), the cannula is energized with ultrasonic 
energy, causing the fat to melt away on contact, an
advantage in areas of scar tissue such as the male <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm">breast</a>, 
back, and in areas of prior liposuction. The disadvantages 
of UAL include the need for longer incisions
in the skin, potential for skin or internal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/burns/article.htm">burns</a>, greater 
cost, and longer time. No matter how liposuction is done,  
it is considered completely cosmetic in nature.
