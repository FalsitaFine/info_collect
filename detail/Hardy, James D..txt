Hardy, James D.: Pioneering American transplant surgeon responsible for three epochal operations: the first human <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6471">lung transplant</a> in 1963, the first animal-to-human <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6416">heart transplant</a> in 1964, and a double-lung transplant that left the heart in place, in 1987. The 1964 transplant of a chimpanzee heart was done three years before the first human-heart transplant (by Christiaan Barnard). Dr. Hardy died in 2003 at the age of 84.
