Medical directives, advance: Advance directives preserve the
person's right to accept or reject a course of medical treatment even after that
person becomes mentally or physically incapacitated to the point of being unable to
communicate those wishes. There are two basic types of advance directives: (1) a living
will, in which the person outlines specific treatment guidelines that are to be followed
by health care providers; (2) a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3666" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">health care proxy</a> (also called a power of attorney for
health-care decision-making) in which the person designates a trusted individual to make
medical decisions in the event that he or she becomes too incapacitated to make such
decisions. Advance directive requirements vary greatly from one jurisdiction to another
and should therefore be drawn up in consultation with an attorney who is familiar with the
laws of the particular jurisdiction. (This entry is based upon material from the National
MS Society).
