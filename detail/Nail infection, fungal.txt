Nail infection, fungal: The most common fungus infection of the nails is onychomycosis.  Onychomycosis makes the nails look white and opaque, thickened, and brittle. Those at increased risk for developing onychomycosis include:<ul> <li>People with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a>;</li> <li>People with disease of the small blood vessels   (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/peripheral_vascular_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">peripheral vascular disease</a>)  Artificial nails increase the risk for onychomycosis because, when an artificial nail is applied, the nail surface is usually abraded with an emery board damaging it, emery boards can carry infection, and  water can collect under the nail creating a moist, warm environment favorable for fungal growth.   Alternative names include tinea unguium.
