Midwife: A trained person who assists women during childbirth. Many midwives also provide <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11898" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">prenatal care</a> for pregnant women, birth education for women and their partners, and care for mothers and newborn babies after the birth. Depending on local law, midwives may deliver babies in the mother's home, in a birthing center or clinic, or in a hospital. Most midwives specialize in normal, uncomplicated deliveries, referring women with health problems that could require hospitalization during birth to a hospital-based obstetrician. Others work with physicians as part of a team. Legal qualifications required to practice midwifery differ among the US states and various countries.
