For instance, in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3907" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">immune system</a> almost all of the key molecules involved in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3906" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">immune response</a> are glycoproteins. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=38400" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">glycopeptide</a> is similar in structure to a glycoprotein but has a shorter chain of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=39555" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">amino acids</a>.
