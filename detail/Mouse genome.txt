Mouse genome: All of the genetic information contained in the laboratory mouse (Mus <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25483" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">musculus</a>). 
The genomes of particular nonhuman organisms such as the mouse have been studied for a number of reasons including the need to improve <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5465" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">sequencing</a> and analysis techniques. These nonhuman genomes also provide powerful sets of data against which to compare the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3818" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">human genome</a>. 
Almost every human gene has a counterpart in the mouse, with similar DNA sequences and basic functions. If the 23 pairs of human chromosomes were broken into smaller blocks, those pieces could be reassembled to produce a serviceable model of the mouse genome.
