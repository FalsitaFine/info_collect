Leishmania infection: A parasitic disease, also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leishmaniasis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">leishmaniasis</a>, spread by the bite of sand flies infected with a protozoa (Leishmania). There are several forms of leishmaniasis, the most common being cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. The cutaneous form of the disease causes skin sores while the visceral form strikes internal organs of the body such as the spleen, liver and bone marrow and can be fatal.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis involves one or more sores on their skin. The sores can change in size and appearance over time. They often end up looking like a volcano, with a raised edge and central crater. Some sores are covered by a scab. The sores can be painless or painful. Some people have swollen glands near the sores (for example, under the arm if the sores are on the arm or hand).

Visceral leishmaniasis usually causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a>, and an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/enlarged_spleen/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">enlarged spleen</a> and liver (usually the spleen is bigger than the liver). Some patients have swollen glands. Certain blood tests are abnormal. For example, patients usually have low blood counts, including a low red blood cell count (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anemia</a>), low white blood cell count, and low platelet count. 
There are about two million new cases of leishmaniasis each year -- 1.5 cutaneous and 0.5 million visceral. The disease is found in the following areas: <ul>
<li>Mexico, Central America, and South America -- from northern Argentina to southern Texas (not in Uruguay, Chile, or Canada) <li>Southern Europe (leishmaniasis is not common in travelers to southern Europe) <li>Asia (not Southeast Asia) <li>The Middle East <li>Africa (particularly East and North Africa, with some   cases elsewhere)</li> </li></li></li></li></ul> More than 90% of the world's visceral leishmaniasis is in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan, and Brazil. 
Leishmaniasis is NOT found in Australia or Oceania (that is, islands in the Pacific, including Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia). It is possible but very unlikely to get leishmaniasis in the USA. Very rarely, people living in rural southern Texas have developed skin sores from cutaneous leishmaniasis. No cases of visceral leishmaniasis are known to have been acquired in the USA. 
Leishmaniasis is spread by the bite of some types of phlebotomine sand flies. Sand flies become infected by biting an infected animal (for example, a rodent or dog) or person. Since sand flies do not make noise when they fly, people may not realize they are present. Sand flies are very small and may be hard to see; they are only about one-third the size of typical mosquitos. Sand flies usually are most active in twilight, evening, and night-time hours (from dusk to dawn). Sand flies are less active during the hottest time of the day. However, they will bite if they are disturbed, such as when a person brushes up against the trunk of a tree where sand flies are resting. Rarely, leishmaniasis is spread from a pregnant woman to her baby. Leishmaniasis also can be spread by blood transfusions or contaminated needles. 
People of all ages are at risk for leishmaniasis if they live or travel where leishmaniasis is found. Leishmaniasis usually is more common in rural than urban areas; but it is found in the outskirts of some cities. The risk for leishmaniasis is highest from dusk to dawn because this is when sand flies are the most active. All it takes to get infected is to be bitten by one infected sand fly. This is more likely to happen the more people are bitten, that is, the more time they spend outside in rural areas from dusk to dawn. Adventure travelers, Peace Corps volunteers, missionaries, ornithologists (people who study birds), other people who do research outdoors at night, and soldiers are examples of people who may have an increased risk for leishmaniasis (especially cutaneous leishmaniasis). 
People with cutaneous leishmaniasis usually develop skin sores within a few weeks (sometimes as long as months) of when they were bitten. People with visceral leishmaniasis usually become sick within several months (rarely as long as years) of when they were bitten. 

Leishmaniasis can be a serious disease if not treated. The skin sores of cutaneous leishmaniasis will heal on their own, but this can take months or even years. The sores can leave ugly <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scars/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scars</a>. If not treated, infection that started in the skin rarely spreads to the nose or mouth and causes sores there (mucosal leishmaniasis). This can happen with some of the types of the parasite found in Central and South America. Mucosal leishmaniasis might not be noticed until years after the original skin sores healed. The best way to prevent mucosal leishmaniasis is to treat the cutaneous infection before it spreads. 
If not treated, visceral leishmaniasis can cause death. 




It is very rare for travelers to get visceral leishmaniasis.

The best way for travelers to prevent getting leishmaniasis is by protecting themselves from sand fly bites. Vaccines and drugs for preventing infection are not yet available. To decrease their risk of being bitten, travelers should: 
<ul>
<li>Stay in well-screened or air-conditioned areas as much as possible. Avoid outdoor activities, especially from dusk to dawn, when sand flies are the most active. When outside, wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks. Tuck your shirt into your pants. 
<li>Apply insect repellent on uncovered skin and under the ends of sleeves and pant legs. Follow the instructions on the label of the repellent. The most effective repellents are those that contain the chemical DEET (N,N-diethylmetatoluamide). The concentration of DEET varies among repellents. Repellents with DEET concentrations of 30-35% are quite effective, and the effect should last about 4 hours. Lower concentrations should be used for children (no more than 10% DEET). Repellents with DEET should be used sparingly on children from 2 to 6 years old and not at all on children less than 2 years old. 
<li>Spray clothing with permethrin-containing insecticides. The insecticide should be reapplied after every five washings. 
<li>Spray living and sleeping areas with an insecticide to kill insects. 
<li>If you are not sleeping in an area that is well screened or air-conditioned, use a bed net and tuck it under your mattress. If possible, use a bed net that has been soaked in or sprayed with permethrin. The permethrin will be effective for several months if the bed net is not washed. Keep in mind that sand flies are much smaller than mosquitoes and therefore can get through smaller holes. Fine-mesh netting (at least 18 holes to the inch; some sources say even finer) is needed for an effective barrier against sand flies. This is particularly important if the bed net has not been treated with permethrin. However, it may be uncomfortable to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a> under such a closely woven bed net when it is hot.</li></li></li></li></li></ul>
