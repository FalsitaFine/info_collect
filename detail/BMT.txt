BMT: Bone marrow transplantation, a procedure in which doctors replace bone marrow that is diseased (or damaged) with healthy bone marrow. The bone marrow to be replaced may be deliberately destroyed by high doses of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chemotherapy</a> and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">radiation therapy</a>. The replacement marrow may come from another person, or it may be the patient's own marrow (which was removed and stored before treatment). When marrow from an unrelated donor is used, the procedure is an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. If the marrow is from an identical twin, it is termed syngeneic. Autologous bone marrow transplantation uses the patient's own marrow.
