Achromatopsia: A hereditary disorder of sight due to a lack of cone vision - that type of vision provided by the cone photoreceptors in the retina. In the normal eye, there are some 6 million cone photoreceptors; they are located largely in the center of the retina. Lacking cones, persons with achromatopsia have to rely on their rod photoreceptors. There are about 100 million rod photoreceptors which are located mainly around the periphery of the retina. Rods saturate at higher levels of illumination and do not provide color vision or good detail vision.
