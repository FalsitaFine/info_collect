Gene markers: Detectable genetic traits or distinctive segments
of DNA that serve as landmarks for a target gene. Markers are on the same chromosome as
the target gene. They must be near enough to the target gene to be genetically linked to
it: to be inherited usually together with that gene, and so serve as signposts to it.
