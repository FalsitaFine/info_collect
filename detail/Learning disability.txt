Learning disability: A   childhood disorder characterized by difficulty with certain skills such as   reading or writing in individuals with normal intelligence. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/learning_disability/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Learning disabilities</a> affect the ability to interpret what one sees and hears or the ability to link information from different parts of the brain. These limitations can show up in many ways -- as specific difficulties with spoken and written language, coordination, self-control, or attention. Such difficulties extend to schoolwork and can impede learning to read or write, or to do math.    Learning disabilities can be lifelong conditions that, in some cases, affect many parts of a person's life: school or work, daily routines, family life, and sometimes even friendships and play. In some people, many overlapping learning disabilities may be apparent. Other people may have a single, isolated learning problem that has little impact on other areas of their lives. A learning disability is often called a learning problem.
