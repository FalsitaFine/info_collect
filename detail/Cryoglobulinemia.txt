Cryoglobulinemia: The presence in blood of abnormal proteins called cryoglobulins that have the unusual property of precipitating from the blood serum when it is chilled and redissolving upon rewarming. Cryoglobulins can increase the risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clots</a> forming in the brain (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stroke</a>), eyes, and heart. Cryoglobulins can also cause inflammation of blood vessels (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vasculitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vasculitis</a>), which increases the risk of artery blockage. Cryoglobulinemia can also accompany another disease, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/multiple_myeloma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">multiple myeloma</a>, dermatomyositis, or lymphoma. Sometimes, small amounts of cryoglobulins are detected in blood samples from people who have no apparent symptoms.
