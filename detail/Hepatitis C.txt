Hepatitis C: Inflammation of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver</a> due to the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is usually spread via <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_transfusion/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">blood transfusion</a> (rare), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemodialysis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">hemodialysis</a>, and needle sticks. The damage <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_c/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hepatitis C</a> does to the liver can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cirrhosis</a> and its complications as well as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>. Transmission of the virus by sexual contact is rare. At least half of hepatitis C patients develop chronic hepatitis C infection. Diagnosis is made by blood test. Treatment and probably cure is via antiviral drugs and is effective in over 90% of patients. Chronic hepatitis C was frequently treated with injectable <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/interferon/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">interferon</a>, in combination with antiviral oral medications, but now is most often treated with oral antivirals alone. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. Previously known as non-A, non-B hepatitis.
