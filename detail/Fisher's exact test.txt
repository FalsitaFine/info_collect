Fisher's exact test: A statistical test of independence much used
in medical research. It tests the independence of rows and columns in a 2 X 2 contingency
table (with 2 horizontal rows crossing 2 vertical columns creating 4 places for data)
based on the exact sampling distribution of the observed frequencies. Hence it is an
"exact" test. Devised by the British geneticist and biostatistician R. A. Fisher
(1890-1962).
