Cervical spondylosis: a common, age-related, wear and tear involving the intervertebral discs of the spine, in the neck (cervical) spine. Spondylosis, or disc disease, can occur anywhere in the spine; the term “cervical” refers to the neck region. Wear and tear causes the discs to shrink and signs of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoarthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">osteoarthritis</a> develop in the surrounding vertebrae (bones of the spine). Cervical spondylosis typically doesn't cause symptoms, but in some cases, it can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/neck_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">neck pain</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/joint_stiffness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">stiffness</a>. If spondylosis causes a narrowing of the space for the spinal cord, the nerves may become compressed, leading to symptoms like coordination problem, numbness and tingling in the extremities or loss of bowel or bladder control.
