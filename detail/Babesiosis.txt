Babesiosis: An illness caused by the parasite <i>Babesia</i> which is transmitted from animals to humans by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ticks/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ticks</a>. In the US, it is typically contracted in the Northeast or Midwest -- in southern New England or New York State and in Wisconsin or Minnesota. The signs and symptoms include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, chills, sweating, myalgias (muscle aches), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a>, hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen) and hemolytic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anemia</a> (anemia due to break-up of red cells).  Symptoms typically occur after an incubation period of 1 to 4 weeks and can last several weeks.  The disease is more severe in patients who are immunosuppressed, splenectomized (lack their spleen), or elderly. It can cause death. Treatment involves antibiotics, usually clindamycin and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/quinine_antimalarial-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">quinine</a> or atovaquone and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/azithromycin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">azithromycin</a>.      <u>The parasite:</u> While more than 100 species of <i>Babesia</i> have been reported, only a few have been identified as causing human infections.  <i>Babesia microti</i> and<i> Babesia divergens</i> have been identified in most human cases, but variants (considered different species) have been recently identified.  Little is known about the occurrence of<i> Babesia</i> species in malarial areas where<i> Babesia</i> can easily be misdiagnosed as Plasmodium (the agent of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/malaria_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">malaria</a>).    <u>The life cycle of the parasite:</u> (This contains some technical information.)  The <i>B. microti</i> life cycle involves two hosts, which includes a rodent, primarily the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus. During a blood meal, a<i> Babesia</i>-infected tick introduces sporozoites into the mouse host. Sporozoites enter erythrocytes and undergo asexual reproduction (budding). In the blood, some parasites differentiate into male and female gametes although these cannot be distinguished at the light microscope level. The definitive host is a tick, in this case the deer tick, Ixodes dammini (I. scapularis). Once ingested by an appropriate tick, gametes unite and undergo a sporogonic cycle resulting in sporozoites. Transovarial transmission (also known as vertical, or hereditary, transmission) has been documented for "large" <i>Babesia spp.</i> but not for the "small" <i> babesia,</i> such as
