Menstrual cycle:  The monthly cycle of changes in the 
ovaries and the lining of the uterus (endometrium), starting with the 
preparation of an egg for fertilization. When the follicle of the 
prepared egg in the ovary breaks, it is released for fertilization 
and ovulation occurs. Unless pregnancy occurs, the cycle ends with 
the shedding of part of the endometrium, which is menstruation. 
Although it is actually the end of the physical cycle, the first day 
of menstrual bleeding is designated as "day 1" of the menstrual cycle 
in medical parlance.
