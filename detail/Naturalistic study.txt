Naturalistic study: A type of study in which the researcher very carefully observes and records some behavior or phenomenon, sometimes over a prolonged period, in its natural setting while interfering as little as possible with the subjects or phenomena. In medical research, a naturalistic study usually involves observing people as they go about their normal activities. The presence of an observer obviously has an effect as one goes about one's daily activities.
