Adiponectin: A protein hormone produced and secreted exclusively by adipocytes (fat cells) that regulates the metabolism of lipids and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glucose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">glucose</a>. Adiponectin influences the body's response to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insulin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">insulin</a>. Adiponectin also has antiinflammatory effects on the cells lining the walls of blood vessels.
High blood levels of adiponectin are associated with a reduced risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attack</a>. Low levels of adiponectin are found in people who are obese (and who are at increased risk of a heart attack).
  Adipocytes produce and secrete a number of proteins, including leptin, adipsin,  properdin, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> necrosis factor (TNF). An adipose tissue-specific factor was isolated and termed APM1 (AdiPose Most abundant gene transcript 1). The protein product of APM1 is adiponectin. The APM1 gene maps to chromosome 3q27.
