Corneal topography: Also known as videokeratography or corneal mapping, corneal topography is a method of computer-assisted examination of the cornea, the clear front portion of the eye that transmits and focuses light into the eye. Corneal topography is performed by projecting illuminated rings onto the corneal surface which are reflected back and measured by the instrument. The test results in the generation of a topographical map of the cornea.
