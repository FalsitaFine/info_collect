Hydrogen: The most plentiful element in the universe and one present in all organic compounds. Hydrogen is a gas with an atomic number of 1 and the symbol H. Two isotopes of hydrogen -- <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=26770" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">deuterium</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=26769" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">tritium</a> -- have been used as tracers in metabolic studies. Tritium is a long-lived weak emitter of radiation and can be easily incorporated in large molecules such as DNA, and is therefore much used for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2405" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">autoradiography</a> in the laboratory. Antoine Lavoisier coined the name hydrogen from the Greek hydro (water) + genes (forming), reflecting the fact that water is generated by the combustion of this element.
