Infection, pinworm: An infestation of the intestinal tract by small, white <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pinworm_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pinworms</a> (Enterobius vermicularis). Pinworms are about the length of a staple, and they live for the most part within the human rectum. While a pinworm-infested person is asleep, female pinworms leave the intestines through the anus and deposit eggs on the skin around the anus. Most symptoms of pinworms are mild, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anal_itching/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anal itching</a>, disturbed <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a>, and irritability. Pinworm is the most common worm infection in the US. School-age children have the highest rates of pinworm infestation, followed in frequency by preschoolers. Pinworms spread easily in daycare centers, schools, and homes. Within a few hours of being deposited on the skin around the anus, pinworm eggs become capable of infesting another person. They can survive up to 2 weeks on clothing, bedding, or other objects. If pinworms are suspected, transparent adhesive tape or a pinworm paddle supplied by a health care provider is applied to the anal region. The eggs adhere to the sticky tape or paddle and are identified via examination under a microscope. Also known as enterobiasis. Treatment requires antibiotics.
