High phe is a teratogen. It can damage a baby before birth.   Women with PKU who are off the special PKU diet should restart back it, ideally prior to conception. During <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a> they must be on the diet and have their blood phe levels carefully monitored.
