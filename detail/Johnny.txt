Johnny: A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=38854" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">hospital gown</a>. A johnny is a short collarless gown that ties in the back, worn by patients being examined or treated in a doctor's office, clinic, or hospital. Johnnies are generally disliked by patients as skimpy, ugly, ill-fitting garments often leaves one's backside ignominiously exposed. In British slang, a johnny is also a condom.
