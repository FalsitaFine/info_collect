Cripple: 1. A person who is lame or disabled.  The word "cripple" is a medically outmoded and politically incorrect term in this usage.  2. To maim or disable a person.   From the Anglo-Saxon "creopan" meaning "to creep."   Someone who was crippled, as from an oxcart rolling over his   leg, had to creep along.
