Evolution, biologic:  Biologic evolution was 
contrasted with cultural (social) evolution in 1968 by A.G. Motulsky 
who pointed out that biologic evolution is mediated by genes, shows a 
slow rate of change, employs random variation (mutations) and 
selection as agents of change, new variants are often harmful, these 
new variants are transmitted from parents to offspring, the mode of 
transmission is simple, complexity is achieved by the rare formation 
of new genes by chromosome duplication, biologic evolution occurs 
with all forms of life, and the biology of humans requires cultural 
evolution.
