Lightening: Not to be 
confused with a discharge of atmospheric electricity, lightening refers to the 
sensation that a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10695">pregnant</a> woman feels when the baby drops. This is the time when the presenting (lowermost) part of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3424">fetus</a> descends into the 
maternal pelvis.
Lightening classically occurs 2 to 3 weeks before <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6194">labor</a> begins. However, 
it may not occur in women who have had two or more prior viable pregnancies (and so are multiparas) until labor actually begins.
Lightening is also called "engagement" because the presenting part of the fetus is then engaged in the mother's pelvis.
