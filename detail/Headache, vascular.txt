Headache, vascular: A group of headaches felt to 
involve abnormal sensitivity of the blood vessels 
(arteries) in the brain to various triggers, resulting in 
rapid changes in the artery size due to spasm 
(constriction). Other arteries in the brain and scalp then 
open (dilate), and throbbing pain is perceived in the head. 
Migraine headaches are the most common type of vascular 
headache. See also <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine/article.htm">migraine headache</a>.
