Flush: (1) A redness of the skin, typically over the cheeks 
or neck.  A flush is usually temporary and brought on by excitement, 
exercise, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm">fever</a>, or embarrassment.  Flushing is an involuntary 
(uncontrollable) response of the nervous system leading to widening 
of the capillaries of the involved skin. Also referred to as a blush 
(or, as a verb, to blush). Flushing may also be caused by medications 
or other substances that cause widening of the capillaries, such as 
niacin.	(2) Flush also means to wash out a wound 
or body area.
