Insemination, homologous:  A procedure in which a 
fine catheter (tube) is
inserted through the cervix (the natural opening of the 
uterus) into the
uterus (the womb) to deposit a sperm sample from the 
woman's mate directly
into the uterus. The purpose of this procedure is to 
achieve fertilization
and pregnancy. Also termed artificial insemination by 
husband (AIH). AIH is
distinguished from artificial insemination by donor (AID) 
in which the donor
is a man other than the woman's mate.
