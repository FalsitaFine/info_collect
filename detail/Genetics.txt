Genetics: The scientific study of heredity. Genetics pertains to humans and all other organisms. So, for example, there is human genetics, mouse genetics, fruit fly genetics, etc.   Human genetics today comprises a number of overlapping fields, including:  <ul> <li>Classical or formal genetics -- the study of the transmission of single genes within families and the analysis of more complex types of inheritance.  <li>Clinical genetics -- the diagnosis, prognosis and, in some cases, the treatment of genetic diseases.  <li><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_counseling/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Genetic counseling</a> -- an important area within clinical genetics involving the diagnosis, risk assessment, and interpersonal communication.   <li>(<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Cancer</a> genetics -- the study of genetic factors in inherited and sporadic cancer.  <li>Cytogenetics -- the study of chromosomes in health and disease.  <li>Biochemical genetics -- the biochemistry of nucleic acids and proteins including enzymes.  <li>Pharmacogenetics -- how genes govern the absorption, metabolism and disposal of drugs and untoward reactions to them.  <li>Molecular genetics -- the molecular study of genetics including particularly DNA and RNA.  <li>Immunogenetics -- the genetics of the immune system including blood groups, HLA, and the immunoglobulins.  <li>Behavioral genetics -- the study of genetic factors in behavior in health and disease including mental retardation and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mental_illness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mental illness</a>.  <li>Population genetics -- the study of genes within populations including gene frequencies, the gene pool, and evolution.   <li>Reproductive genetics -- the genetics of reproduction including genes and chromosomes in germ cells and the early embryo.  <li>Developmental genetics -- the genetics of normal and abnormal development including congenital malformations (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_defects/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">birth defects</a>).   (Cancer genetics- The study of the genetic factors in inherited and sporadic cancer) <li>Ecogenetics -- the interaction of genetics with the  environment.   <li>Forensic genetics -- the application of genetic knowledge, including DNA, to legal matters. </li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
