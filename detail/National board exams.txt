National board exams: The National board exams in medicine refer to the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). This exam is sponsored by The Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) of the United States and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME). It has replaced the examinations previously used to fulfill examination requirements for medical licensure: the Federation Licensing Examination (FLEX) and the certifying examinations of the NBME, Parts I, II, and III. USMLE provides a common evaluation system for all applicants for medical licensure. Results of the USMLE are reported to medical licensing authorities in the United States for use in granting the initial license to practice medicine.
