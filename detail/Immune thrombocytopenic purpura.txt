(Autoantibodies are antibodies directed against the patient's own cells, in this disorder, the patient's own platelets.) <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thrombocytopenia_low_platelet_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Thrombocytopenia</a> refers to a decrease in platelets (also known as thrombocytes). Purpura pertains to the visible hallmarks: purplish areas in the skin and mucous membranes (such as the mouth lining) where bleeding has occurred as a result of decreased platelets.
