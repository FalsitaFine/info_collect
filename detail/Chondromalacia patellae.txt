Chondromalacia patellae: The patellofemoral syndrome (PFS), the most common cause of chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/knee_pain_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">knee pain</a>. PFS characteristically causes vague discomfort
of the inner knee area, aggravated by activity (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/running/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">running</a>, jumping, climbing
or descending stairs) or by prolonged sitting with knees in a moderately
bent position (the so-called "theater sign" of pain upon arising from a
desk or theater seat). The knee may be mildly swollen. If chronic symptoms
are ignored, the loss of quadriceps strength may cause the leg to "give
out."
