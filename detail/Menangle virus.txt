The virus also caused an influenza-like illness in two of the workers at the piggery. They later recovered. Fruit bats (flying foxes) near the piggery had antibodies to the Menangle virus, indicating that they had been exposed to the virus. It is believed that fruit bats are the natural host of the virus, and it was a relatively rare event that led to the virus "jumping" into pigs.
The Menangle virus belongs to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=22713" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">paramyxovirus</a> family.
