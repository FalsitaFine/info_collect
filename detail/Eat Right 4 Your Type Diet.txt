Eat Right 4 Your Type Diet: The Eat Right 4 Your Type Diet is a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a> plan based upon the concept that your blood type (referring to the ABO blood types: O, A, B, and AB)              influences the foods that will be healthiest for you and which foods will be "empty" calories that add up to excess weight. Sometimes referred to as the "blood type diet," the plan makes specific dietary recommendations based upon your blood type and urges followers to eat only foods that are harmonious with their own blood type. The diet was popularized by Peter D'Adamo, a naturopathic physician in the 1996 book <i>Eat Right 4 Your Type.</i> Critics of the diet emphasize that there has been no evidence published in the medical literature to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theory or method.
