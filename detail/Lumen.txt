Lumen: A luminous term referring to the channel within a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6297">tube</a> such as a blood vessel or to the cavity within a hollow organ such as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4004">intestine</a>. Lumen is a luminous term because it is Latin for light, including the light that comes through a window. When a hollow organ is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11133">cut</a> across, you can see light through the space that has been opened.
