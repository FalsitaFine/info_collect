Blepharoptosis: an abnormal, low-lying upper eyelid margin. Drooping eyelids may occur on both sides (bilateral) or on one side only (unilateral), in which case it is more easily noticed. Congenital <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ptosis/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="SYM">ptosis</a> is eyelid drooping that is present at birth; when it develops later, it is referred to as acquired ptosis. Blepharoptosis may be barely noticeable or quite prominent. Some sagging of the skin and connective tissues occurs during the normal aging process, potentially leading to drooping of the eyelids. Other causes include conditions that affect the muscles and nerves of the eyelid as well as conditions that affect the skin and connective tissues of the eyelid.
