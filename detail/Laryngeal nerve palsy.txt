Laryngeal nerve palsy:  Paralysis of the larynx (voice box) 
caused by damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve or its parent 
nerve, the vagus nerve, which originates in the brainstem and runs 
down to the colon. The recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies the larynx 
(voice box). The larynx will be paralyzed on the side where this 
nerve has been damaged, unless the problem originated with damage to 
the vagus nerve itself. Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve can 
result from diseases inside the chest, such as a tumor, an aneurysm 
of the arch of the aorta, or an aneurysm of the left atrium of the 
heart.
