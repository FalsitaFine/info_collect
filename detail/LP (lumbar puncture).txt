LP (lumbar puncture): Also known as a spinal tap, an LP is a
procedure whereby spinal fluid is removed from the spinal canal for the purpose of
diagnostic testing. It is particularly helpful in the diagnosis of inflammatory diseases
of the central nervous system, especially infections, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalitis_and_meningitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">meningitis</a>. It can also
