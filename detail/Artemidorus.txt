Artemidorus: Artemidorus of Daldis. Greek physician who wrote Oneirocritica, a work dedicated to the interpretation of dreams, in the middle of the second century C.E. Artemidorus gathered evidence during interviews with thousands of people about their dreams. While his work has often been dismissed as mere divination, the careful study of dreams by modern psychiatrists has brought them back into the realm of scientific observation.
"In later antiquity Artemidorus of Daldis was regarded as the greatest authority on dream-interpretation ..." (Sigmund Freud, The Interpretation of Dreams)
