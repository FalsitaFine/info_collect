Keratectomy, photorefractive (PRK): A kind of laser eye surgery designed
to change the shape of the cornea to eliminate (or reduce) the need for
glasses and contact lenses. The laser is used to remove the outer layer of
the cornea and flatten the cornea. The flattening of the cornea is intended
to correct <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/myopia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">myopia</a> (nearsightedness) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/astigmatism_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">astigmatism</a> (uneven curvature of the
cornea that distorts vision). PRK is an ambulatory procedure done in the
office with numbing eye drops. It takes about a minute to do and about 3
days to heal.
No
eye patch need be worn after PRK.
