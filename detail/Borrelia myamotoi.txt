infection that are never identified, and the exact number of humans that have 
been infected is not known. While the bacteria were first identified in Japan, 
the first human infections were described in Russia in 2011. <i>Borrelia myamotoi</i> 
disease (BMD) is treated with the same antibiotics used to treat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lyme_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Lyme disease</a>. 
Diagnostic tests for the bacterial infection are not widely available and rely 
on demonstrating the genetic material of the organism.
