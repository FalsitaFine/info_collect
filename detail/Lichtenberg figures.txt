Lichtenberg figures: A fern-leaf pattern of reddish, painless marks on the skin that are a result of a skin reaction to a lightning strike. The pattern typically vanishes in a few hours or days.  Lichtenberg figures are named after Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, a German physicist, who described similar patterns in 1777, while experimenting with static electricity.
