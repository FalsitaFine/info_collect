Nasopharynx: The area of the upper throat that lies behind the nose. In contrast to the oropharynx, the area of the throat that lies behind the mouth.
The word "nasopharynx" is a hybrid -- part Latin, part Greek. 
"Naso-" is a prefix that has to do with the nose. It comes from the 
Latin "nasus" for the nose (or snout). "Pharynx" is the Greek word 
for throat. The Greco-Roman term "nasopharynx" was coined in 1877.
