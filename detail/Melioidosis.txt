Melioidosis: An infectious illness, also called Whitmore's   disease, that is most frequent in Southeast Asia and Northern   Australia and is caused by a bacteria called <i>Burkholderia   pseudomallei</i> found in soil, rice paddies and stagnant waters.    Humans catch the disease by inhalation of contaminated dust or when soil contaminated by the bacteria comes in contact with abraded (scraped) skin.
