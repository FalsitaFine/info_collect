Compound heterozygote: The presence of two different mutant alleles at a particular gene locus, one on each chromosome of a pair.  The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3818" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">human genome</a> contains two copies of each gene, a paternal and a maternal allele. A mutation affecting only one allele is called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.comhttps://www.medicinenet.com/gout_gouty_arthritis/article.htm8" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">heterozygous</a>. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33676" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">homozygous</a> mutation is the presence of the identical mutation on both alleles of a specific gene. However, when both alleles of a gene harbor mutations, but the mutations are different, these mutations are called compound heterozygous. Also called a genetic compound.
