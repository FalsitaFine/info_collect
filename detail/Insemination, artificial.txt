Insemination, artificial:  A procedure in which a 
fine catheter (tube) is
inserted through the cervix (the natural opening of the 
uterus) into the
uterus (the womb) to deposit a sperm sample directly into 
the uterus. The
purpose of this relatively simple procedure is to achieve 
fertilization and
pregnancy. Artificial insemination is also called 
intrauterine insemination
(IUI).
