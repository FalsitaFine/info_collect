Nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease: damage to the lung due to infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). The genus <i>Mycobacteria</i> includes NTM as well as many other kinds of bacteria, including those responsible for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tuberculosis_tb_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tuberculosis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leprosy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">leprosy</a>. NTM are bacteria that occur naturally in water and soil. There are more than 150 types of NTM. In most people, they do not cause problems, but they can cause chronic lung disease in people with a weakened immune system. NTM infections typically affect older people but can occur in any age group. The infection may become chronic and require long-term antibiotic treatment.
