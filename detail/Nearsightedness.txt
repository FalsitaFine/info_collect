Nearsightedness: The ability 
to see near objects more clearly than distant objects. Also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/myopia/article.htm">myopia</a>               .
Myopia can be caused by a longer-than-normal eyeball or by any condition that prevents light rays from focusing on the retina. 
Most forms of myopia can be managed with corrective lenses. Surgery is available to permanently correct some forms of myopia, although long-term effectiveness and safety has not been fully determined.
