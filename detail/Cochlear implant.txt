Cochlear implant: A device that is surgically placed (implanted) within the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7210" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">inner ear</a> to help a person with a certain form of deafness to hear. Cochlear implants rarely cure severe or profound deafness, but they can help some hearing-impaired people to distinguish the sounds of language clearly enough to participate in a verbal environment. For children who are congenitally deaf (born deaf), a cochlear implant can markedly increase a preschool child's chances of being able to function effectively in mainstream school classes.
