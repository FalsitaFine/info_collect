Disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary (COPD): Any disorder that persistently obstructs bronchial airflow. COPD mainly involves two related diseases -- <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_bronchitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chronic bronchitis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/emphysema_lung_condition/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">emphysema</a>. Both cause chronic obstruction of air flowing through the airways and in and out of the lungs. The obstruction is generally permanent and progresses (becomes worse) over time.
