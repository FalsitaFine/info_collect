Car booster seat: A car seat for a child who has outgrown both an infant seat and a toddler seat. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6994" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> recommend that: <ol>
<li><u>All children 12 and under</u> should ride in the <u>back seat</u>.
<li>Children over 40 lbs. up to 80 lbs. should sit in a belt-positioning <u>booster seat with both lap and shoulder belt</u>. <li>The booster seat should <u>face forward</u>. <li><u>Snug belts</u>: The lap belt should fit low and tight across the lap/upper thigh area of the child and the shoulder belt should fit snug crossing the chest and shoulder (to avoid abdominal injuries).
