Corns: Small calloused areas of skin caused by local pressure irritating tissue over a bony prominence. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/corns/article.htm">Corns</a> most commonly occur over a toe where they form what is referred to as a hard corn. Between the toes, pressure can form a soft corn of macerated skin which often yellows.  
The word corn comes from the Latin cornu meaning horn or hoof. A corn on the toe is also called a clavus.
