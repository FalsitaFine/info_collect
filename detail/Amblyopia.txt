Amblyopia: Partial or complete loss of vision in one <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7021">eye</a> caused by conditions that affect the normal development of vision. These conditions include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=12157">strabismus</a>, in which the eyes are crossed inward (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3331">esotropia</a>) or turned outward (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3356">exotropia</a>) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=20150">anisometropia</a>, in which there is a major difference in refractive error between the two eyes from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10611">nearsightedness</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10569">farsightedness</a>, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2374">astigmatism</a>. Less common causes of amblyopia include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5115">ptosis</a> (drooping) of one eyelid, disease of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7248">cornea</a> (preventing light from entering the eye), congenital <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2645">cataract</a>, and injury to the eye of a young child. 
In amblyopia, the brain favors one eye over the other. The other eye is ignored. It is not adequately stimulated and the visual brain cells do not mature normally. Amblyopia is the most common cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23256">monocular</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=20629">blindness</a>, partial or complete blindness in one eye. Amblyopia affects 2 to 3% of children in the US. 
Treatment of strabismus may involve surgical correction of the eye muscle imbalance. In the case of severe refractive error, it should be corrected by glasses, contact lenses or, if appropriate, lasix. Wearing an eye patch over the stronger eye is a hallowed treatment for amblyopia. Another option is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10952">atropine</a> eye drops to blur the vision temporarily in the stronger eye. Weekend atropine provides an improvement in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8241">visual acuity</a> of a magnitude similar to that provided by daily atropine in treating moderate amblyopia.  
The term "amblyopia" is sometimes incorrectly used interchangeably with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=20082">lazy eye</a>. "Amblyopia" is made up of ambly- from the Greek "amblys" meaning blunt, dull, faint, or dim and -opia from the Greek "ops" meaning eye, and refers to vision, so amblyopia is literally dim vision.
