Brunhilde virus: Type 1 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=40557" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">poliovirus</a>. Named after a female chimpanzee from which it was first isolated. There are two other strains of poliovirus: Type 2 (known as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=40555" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Lansing virus</a>) and Type 3 (known as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=40556" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Leon virus</a>). Immunity to one strain does not provide protection against the other two. All three strains are therefore included in the poliovirus vaccine.
