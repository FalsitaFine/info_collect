Named after the city in Michigan where the first patient lived who was found to have this virus. There are two other strains of poliovirus: Type 1 (known as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=40554" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Brunhilde virus</a>) and Type 3 (known as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=40556" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Leon virus</a>). Immunity to one strain does not provide protection against the other two. All three strains are therefore included in the poliovirus vaccine.
