It can be transmitted to humans by bites or licks from a cat or dog. In healthy people, the bacteria typically do not cause any problems. However, in very rare cases, people with suppressed immune system function (particularly people who have lost their spleen) and other conditions may develop a potentially fatal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/flu/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">flu-like</a> illness from the infection. Testing for the Capnocytophaga canimorsus is not recommended since it is normally present in animals and humans and serious infections are rare.
