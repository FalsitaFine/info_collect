The disease produces slowly developing, painless ulcers on the genital organs that may bleed. Nodules beneath the skin in the affected area may be found. The condition is rare in the US, but is common in some developing areas of the world including India, New Guinea, and the Caribbean. The diagnosis of granuloma inguinale requires demonstration of the bacteria in a tissue sample. Granuloma inguinale is sometimes referred to as donovanosis.
