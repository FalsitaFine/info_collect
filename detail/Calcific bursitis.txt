that reduces friction forces between tissues of the body. Chronic (repeated of
long-standing) inflammation of the bursa (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acute_and_chronic_bursitis/article.htm">bursitis</a>) can lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/calcific_bursitis/article.htm">calcification of the
bursa</a>. This is referred to as "calcific bursitis." The calcium deposition
(calcification) can occur as long as the inflammation is present.
