Burn treatment: The treatment of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/burns/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">burns</a> depends on the depth,
area and location of the burn. Burn depth is generally categorized as first, second or
third degree. A first degree burn is superficial and has similar characteristics to a
typical sun burn. The skin is red in color and sensation is intact. In fact, it is usually
somewhat painful. Second degree burns look similar to the first degree burns; however, the
damage is now severe enough to cause blistering of the skin and the pain is usually
somewhat more intense. In third degree burns the damage has progressed to the point of
skin death. The skin is white and without sensation.
