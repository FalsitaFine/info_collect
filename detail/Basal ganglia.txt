Basal ganglia: A region of the base of the brain that consists of three clusters of neurons (caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus) that are responsible for involuntary movements such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tremor/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tremors</a>, athetosis, and chorea. The basal ganglia are abnormal in a number of important neurologic conditions, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/parkinsons_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Parkinson's disease</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/huntington_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Huntington's disease</a>.
