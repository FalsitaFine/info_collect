Coloboma: A congenital malformation (birth defect) in which part of the eye does not form due to failure of fusion of an embryonic feature called the intraocular fissure. The resultant coloboma can be likened to a missing slice from a pie that may involve a number of different structures within the eye including the choroid, iris, lens, optic nerve, and retina.
