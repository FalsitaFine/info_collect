DNA replication: A complex process whereby the 'parent' strands of DNA in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3109" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">double helix</a> are separated, and each one is copied to produce a new (daughter) strand. This process is said to be 'semiconservative' because one strand from each parent is conserved and remains intact after replication has taken place.
