Beard: The hair that normally grows on the male face after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puberty/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">puberty</a>. Testosterone, the most potent of the naturally occurring androgens, causes the development of secondary sex features such as the beard that are characteristic of the adult male. Although there is normally hair on everyone's face, the growth of a real beard on the face of a young child or a woman is not. It is a form of hirsutism (hairiness) and can sometimes reflect an underlying disorder.
The term "beard" may exclude the mustache.
