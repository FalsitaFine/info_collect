Golfer's cramp: A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dystonia/article.htm">dystonia</a> that affects the
muscles of the hand and sometimes the forearm and only occurs when playing golf. Similar
focal dystonias have also been called typist's cramp, pianist's cramp,
musician's cramp, and writer's cramp. Golfer's cramp provides a
reason to switch to tennis (and get tennis elbow).
