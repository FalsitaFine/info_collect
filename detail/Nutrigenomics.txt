Nutrigenomics: The study of how different foods may interact with specific <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15391">genes</a> to increase the risk of common chronic diseases such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18055">type 2 diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4607">obesity</a>, heart disease, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9791">stroke</a> and certain cancers. Nutrigenomics also seeks to provide a molecular understanding of how common chemicals in the diet affect health by altering the expression of genes and the structure of an individual's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3580">genome</a>. The premise underlying nutrigenomics is that the influence of diet on health depends on an individual's genetic makeup.
