Norplant contraceptive: Implantable progestin in the form of Norplant was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for contraception in 1990 and the newer Norplant 2 was approved in 1996 for contraception.   It is no longer available in the United States. Made up of matchstick-sized rubber rods, this contraceptive device is surgically implanted under the skin of the woman's upper arm, where it steadily releases a contraceptive substance (a progestin hormone called levonorgestrel).
