Arrectores pilorum: Tiny muscles that act as the hair erector muscles. The arrectores pilorum play a key role in goose <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bumps_on_skin/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">bumps</a>, a temporary local change in the skin The chain of events leading to this skin change starts with a stimulus such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cold</a> or fear. That stimulus causes a nerve discharge from theÂ sympathetic nervous system, a portion of the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system. The nerve discharge causes contraction of the arrectores pilorum (the hair erector muscles). Contraction of these muscles elevates the hair follicles above the rest of the skin. And it is these tiny elevations we perceive as goose bumps.
