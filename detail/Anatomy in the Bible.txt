Anatomy in the Bible: There are in the Bible but few direct references to the internal organs. Biblical poetry, however, abounds with expressions in which the names of such organs are used metaphorically, e.g.: "His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground" (Job xvi. 13); "His vessels are full of healthy fluid, and the marrow of his bones is well moistened" (ib. xxi. 24, Hebr.); "I am weary; . . . my throat is dried" (Ps. lxix.)
