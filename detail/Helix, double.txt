Helix, double: The structure of DNA with the two strands of DNA spiraling about one other. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3109" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">double helix</a> looks something like an immensely long ladder twisted into a helix, or coil. The sides of the "ladder" are formed by a backbone of sugar and phosphate molecules, and the "rungs" consist of nucleotide bases joined weakly in the middle by hydrogen bonds.  "The Double Helix" is the title of a excellent book by James
Watson telling the story of his and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32828" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Francis Crick</a>'s discovery of the correct model for DNA.
