FODMAPs: an acronym for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. These are a group of sugar-related <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15381" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">carbohydrates</a> that have been termed "indigestible" because they are poorly broken down in the intestine and absorbed into the body.  The FODMAPs are fermented by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=13954" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">bacteria</a> within the intestine with the production of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gas</a> and the secretion of fluid into the intestine. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25973" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Lactose</a>, the sugar in milk, is the most common example of a FODMAP that is poorly digested and absorbed by many people.
