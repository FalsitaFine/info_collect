Bacterial prostatitis, acute: Inflammation of the prostate gland of sudden (acute) onset due to bacterial infection. The symptoms include chills, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, pain in the lower back and genital area, body aches, burning or painful urination, and the frequent and urgent need to urinate. The urinary tract is infected, as evidenced by the presence of the white blood cells and bacteria in the urine. Treatment is with antibiotics.
The prostate, a small organ about the size of a walnut, is below the bladder (where urine is stored) and surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder). The prostate normally produces a fluid that becomes part of the semen.
