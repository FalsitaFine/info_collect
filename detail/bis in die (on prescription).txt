bis in die (on prescription): Seen on a prescription, bid means 
twice (two times) a day. It is
an abbreviation for "bis in die" which in Latin means twice 
a day. The
abbreviation bid is sometimes written without a period 
either in
lower-case letters as "bid" or in capital letters as 
"BID" or with periods as "b.i.d."  However it is
written, it is one of a number of hallowed abbreviations of 
Latin terms that
have been traditionally used in prescriptions to specify 
the frequency with
which medicines should be taken.
