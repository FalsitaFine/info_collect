Acute bronchitis: inflammation of the breathing tubes within the lungs (bronchial tubes or bronchi) as a result of an infection (viral or bacterial) or a chemical irritant (such as smoke or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm">gastric acid reflux</a>). The inflammation causes swelling of the lining of these breathing tubes, narrowing the tubes and promoting secretion of inflammatory fluid. Most commonly, acute bronchitis is due to a viral infection. Common viruses that cause bronchitis include the rhinovirus, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/respiratory_syncytial_virus/article.htm">respiratory syncytial virus</a> (RSV), and the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm">influenza virus</a>.
