NARP is a disease featuring <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weakness</a> of the muscles near the trunk, ataxia (wobbliness), retinal disease, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures_symptoms_and_types/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">seizures</a> and developmental delay. NARP is a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mitochondrial_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mitochondrial disease</a> in that it is due to a mutation (change) in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the DNA of the mitochondrion, a structure situated in the cytoplasm of the cell rather than in the nucleus where all the other chromosomes are located. All mtDNA is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a> from the mother. There are 2 to 10 copies of the mtDNA genome in each mitochondrion. mtDNA is a double-stranded, circular molecule. It is very small relative to the chromosomes in the nucleus and so contains only a limited number of genes. It is specialized in the information it carries and encodes a number of the subunits in the mitochondrial respiratory-chain complex that the cell needs to respire. Mutations (changes) in mtDNA can cause disease. The mutations often impair the function of oxidative-phosphorylation enzymes in the respiratory chain. This is especially manifest in tissues with a high energy expenditure such as brain and muscle.
