Forensic anthropology: The application of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=13754" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">science</a> of physical anthropology to the legal process. Forensic anthropology includes the identification of skeletal, decomposed, or unidentified human remains. Forensic anthropologists may team up with forensic pathologists, forensic dentists, and homicide detectives to identify a dead person and the time and manner of their death. Forensic anthropology may also help determine the age, sex, stature, and unique features of the deceased from their remains. DNA forensics, blood groups, and fingerprints are all tools of the trade in forensic anthropology today.
