Corrigan pulse: A pulse that is forceful and then suddenly collapses. It is usually found in patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=31850" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">aortic regurgitation</a>, a condition caused by a leaky <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2298" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">aortic valve</a>. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9127" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">left ventricle</a> of the heart ejects blood under high pressure into the aorta. Then the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=19428" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">aortic</a> valve normally shuts tight so that blood cannot return to the ventricle. If, however, the aortic valve cannot close completely, the blood in the aorta comes sloshing back into the ventricle, and the pressure and the pulse collapse. Also known as water-hammer pulse.
