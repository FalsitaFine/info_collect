Battle fatigue: The World War II name for what is known
today as post-traumatic stress, this is a psychological disorder that develops in some
individuals who have had major traumatic experiences (and, for example, have been in a
serious accident or through a war). The person is typically numb at first but later has
symptoms including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm">depression</a>, excessive irritability, guilt (for having survived while
others died), recurrent nightmares, flashbacks to the traumatic scene, and overreaction
to sudden noises. Post-traumatic stress became known as such in the 70s due to the
adjustment problems of some Vietnam veterans.
