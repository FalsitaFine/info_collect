Fire ant sting: A scourge, these red or yellow ants of
small-to-medium size, originally from South America, have a severe sting that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/burns/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">burns</a> like
fire. Their sting-like that of bees, yellow jackets, hornets and wasps -- can trigger
allergic reactions varying greatly in severity. Avoidance and prompt treatment are
essential. In selected cases, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergy</a> injection therapy is highly effective. (The three
"A's" of insect allergy are Adrenaline, Avoidance and Allergist.)
