Ayurveda: India's traditional,   natural system of medicine that has been practiced for more   than 5,000 years. Ayurveda provides an integrated approach   to preventing and treating illness through lifestyle   interventions and natural therapies. Ayurvedic theory   states that all disease begins with an imbalance or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stress</a>   in the individual's consciousness. Lifestyle interventions   are a major ayurvedic preventive and therapeutic approach.   In India, ayurvedic practitioners receive state-  recognized, institutionalized training in parallel to their   physician counterparts in India's state-supported systems   for conventional Western biomedicine and homeopathic   medicine. The research base is growing concerning the   physiological effects of meditative techniques and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/yoga/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">yoga</a>   postures in Indian medical literature and Western   psychological literature. Published studies have documented   reductions in cardiovascular disease risk factors,   including blood pressure, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cholesterol</a>, and reaction to   stress, in individuals who practice Ayurvedic methods.     Laboratory and clinical studies on ayurvedic herbal   preparations and other therapies have shown them to have a   range of potentially beneficial effects for preventing and   treating certain cancers, treating infectious disease,   and promoting health. Mechanisms underlying   these effects may include free-radical scavenging effects,   immune system modulation, brain neurotransmitter   modulation, and hormonal effects.
