Gastric ulcer: A hole in the lining of the stomach
corroded by the acidic digestive juices which are secreted by the stomach cells. Ulcer
formation is related to H. pyloridus bacteria in the stomach, anti-inflammatory
medications, and smoking cigarettes. Ulcer pain may not correlate with the presence or
severity of ulceration. Diagnosis is made with barium x-ray or with the use of a viewing
tube slipped through the throat to the stomach (endoscopy).
