Intestine, large: The tubelike organ that 
completes the process of digestion, receiving material from 
the small intestine. It has four parts: the cecum (caecum), 
the appendix (vermiform appendix), the colon, and the 
rectum. Once the products of digestion enter the cecum 
through the ileocecal valve, they move rapidly past the 
appendix, which juts out from the intestine near the cecum. 
The colon absorbs any remaining water and forms the stool, 
which is send to the rectum for elimination. The walls of 
the large intestine are muscular, and contract to move 
material along its length. See also intestine, small.
