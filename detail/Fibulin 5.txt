Fibulin 5: A protein that belongs to a family of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=24384">extracellular</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15380">proteins</a> expressed in the basement membranes of blood vessels. Fibulin 5 may be essential for the polymerization of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=24541">elastin</a>. Missense mutations in FBLN5, the gene that encodes fibulin 5, appear responsible for 1-2% of cases of age-related macular degeneration (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32055">AMD</a>). FBLN5 is located on chromosome 14 in band 14q32.1. See also: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=34346">Fibulin 3</a>.
