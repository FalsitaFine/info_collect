DNA repair: The process by which a cell uses a series of special enzymes to repair mutations (changes) in DNA and restore the DNA to its original state. The DNA is constantly mutating and being repaired. This repair process is controlled by special genes. A mutation in a DNA repair gene can cripple the repair process and cause a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32065" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cascade</a> of unrepaired mutations in the genome.
