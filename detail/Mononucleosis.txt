Mononucleosis: Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV, human herpesvirus 4, HHV-4) in which there is an increase of 
white blood cells that have a single nucleus (monocytes). The 
infection can be spread by saliva. Its incubation period is four to 
eight weeks. Symptoms include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm">fever</a>, fatigue, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm">sore throat</a>, and 
swollen lymph glands. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/infectious_mononucleosis/article.htm">Mononucleosis</a> can cause liver inflammation 
(hepatitis) and spleen enlargement; vigorous contact sports should be 
avoided to prevent spleen rupture. It is less severe in young 
children. Most people exposed to EBV do not develop mononucleosis: 
most adults carry an antibody against EBV in their blood, meaning 
they have been infected with EBV at some time. Treatment includes 
rest, pain medication, and in some cases anti-viral medication. 
Also 
known as mono, the kissing disease.  See also Epstein-Barr 
virus.
