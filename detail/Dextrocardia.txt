Dextrocardia: The heart is reversed and is in the right
side of the chest rather than in its normal location on the left. This is a true anatomic
reversal. With dextrocardia, for example, the apex (tip) of the heart points to the right
rather than (as is normal) to the left. Dextrocardia occurs in an abnormal condition
present at birth (congenital) called Kartagener's syndrome.
