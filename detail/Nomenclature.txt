Nomenclature: A system of names used in a particular discipline, as in medicine and surgery, anatomy and biochemistry, etc. A standard system of nomenclature presupposes the existence of an organized classification of the entities within that field.   From the Latin nomenclatura, a listing of names, from nomen, name, + calo, to proclaim. The USSR and other Communist countries used the term nomenklatura to refer to a system of government patronage.
