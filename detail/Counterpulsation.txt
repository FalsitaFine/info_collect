Counterpulsation: A technique that synchronizes the external pumping of blood with the heart's cycle to assist the circulation and decreasing the work of the heart. Counterpulsation pumps when the heart is resting to increase blood flow and oxygen to the heart. Counterpulsation stops pumping when the heart is working to decrease the heart's workload and lessen oxygen demand.
