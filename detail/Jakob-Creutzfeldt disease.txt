It is believed to be caused by an unconventional microbe called a prion, rather than by bacteria or a virus. Abbreviated CJD. Symptoms of CJD include forgetfulness, nervousness, trembling hand movements, unsteady gait, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/muscle_spasms/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">muscle spasms</a>, chronic dementia, balance disorder, and loss of facial expression. CJD is classified as a spongiform <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalopathy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">encephalopathy</a>, and it has some relationship to animal diseases in that category, most notably bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mad_cow_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mad cow disease</a>). There is neither treatment nor cure for CJD. Also known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome, Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, and spastic pseuodoparalysis.
