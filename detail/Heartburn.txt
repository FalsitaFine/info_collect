Heartburn: An uncomfortable 
feeling of burning and warmth occurring in waves rising up behind the breastbone 
(sternum) toward the neck. It is usually due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd/article.htm">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a> (GERD), the rise of stomach acid back up into the esophagus. Heartburn has nothing whatsoever to do with the heart. It is a popular nonmedical term. It is medically called pyrosis.
