Medical etymology: The   origin of medical words and terms. Etymology is an account of the origins and   the developments in the meaning of a word or term. Medical etymology brings us   into contact with the "history of medicine, of human ideas, and of the human   struggle to understand the forces of nature that determine human destiny and mortality," as Dr. John Dirckx has put it.  For an example of a medical etymology, the word "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a>" is borrowed from the   Greek word meaning "a siphon." The 2nd-century A.D. Greek physician, Aretus the   Cappadocian, named the condition "diabetes." He explained that patients with it had polyuria and "passed water like a siphon."
