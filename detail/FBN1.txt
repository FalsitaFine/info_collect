FBN1: The fibrillin 1 gene. This gene is mutated in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/marfan_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Marfan syndrome</a>, the MASS syndrome, and related disorders of connective tissue. The FBN1 gene produces a protein called fibrillin-1 which is transported out of the cell and deposited in the extracellular matrix, the intricate lattice in which cells are embedded to build tissues. In this matrix, fibrillin becomes part of small threadlike filaments called microfibrils, which in turn help build elastic fibers. Elastic fibers are essential for the function of flexible structures such as blood vessels, the lungs, and skin.
