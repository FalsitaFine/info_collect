Memory: 1. The ability to recover information about 
past events or knowledge. 
2. The process of recovering information about past events or knowledge. 
3. Cognitive reconstruction. The brain engages in a remarkable reshuffling process in an attempt to extract what is general and what is particular about each passing moment.
Memory may be divided into short-term (also known as 
working or recent memory) and long-term memory. Short-term memory
recovers memories of recent events, while long-term memory is 
concerned with recalling the more distant past. 
Some disorders, such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_causes_stages_and_symptoms/article.htm">Alzheimer's disease</a>, damage the 
cognitive systems that control memory. Usually long-term 
memory is retained while short-term memory is lost; 
conversely, memories may become jumbled, leading to 
mistakes in recognizing people or places that should be 
familiar.
