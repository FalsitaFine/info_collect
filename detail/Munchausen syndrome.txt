Munchausen syndrome: (This is an alternate entry to Munchhausen syndrome with two h's in Munchhausen. Whole medical reports have been written about the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/munchausen_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Munchausen syndrome</a> incorrectly written with one h.)  Recurrent feigning of catastrophic illnesses, a psychological disorder that is characterized by the recurrent presentation of the patient for treatment of an acute and often dire illness that is, in reality, not present. The person with Munchhausen syndrome usually gives a plausible and dramatic history. All of it is entirely false. The patient tends to go from hospital to hospital feigning medical or surgical diseases and giving false and fanciful information about their medical and social background. They may even have unnecessary surgery repeatedly, resulting for example in a "mass of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scars/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scars</a>" on the abdomen, what has been called a "gridiron abdomen." Some patients with Munchhausen's syndrome cause their own illness, as by secretly ingesting or injecting substances.
