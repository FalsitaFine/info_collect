Inflammatory response: A fundamental type of response by the body to disease and injury, a response characterized by the classical signs of "dolor, calor, rubor, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5863">tumor</a>" -- <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4723">pain</a>, heat (localized warmth), redness, and swelling. 
Innumerable insults (a mosquito bite, a splinter, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5997">virus</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=12923">infection</a>, a bruise, a broken bone) can trigger an inflammatory response and dispatch cells and chemicals to the site to repair the damage. Inflammation is a key part of the body's defense system, an indispensable protective response by the body's system of self-defense.
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2133">Acute</a> inflammation is short-lived, lasting only a few days. If it lasts longer, it is referred to as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2728">chronic</a> inflammation. Chronic inflammation may last weeks, months, or beyond. Paradoxically, the inflammatory <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5054">process</a> itself may cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5800">tissue</a> damage while it is engaged in healing and repair. Thus, inflammation may play a role in such diverse disorders as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2213">Alzheimer disease</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10375">meningitis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15018">atherosclerosis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2899">cystic fibrosis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2373">asthma</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2740">cirrhosis</a> of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4179">liver</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7536">inflammatory bowel disease</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7537">IBD</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11148">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4686">osteoporosis</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5104">psoriasis</a>.
