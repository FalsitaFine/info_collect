Cystine transport disease: Commonly known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cystinuria/article.htm">cystinuria</a>, this is an inherited (genetic) disorder of the transport of an amino acid (a building block of protein) called cystine resulting in an excess of cystine in the urine (cystinuria) and the formation of cystine stones.
Cystinuria is the most common defect in the transport of an amino acid. Although cystine is not the only overly excreted amino acid in cystinuria, it is the least soluble of all naturally occurring amino acids. Cystine tends to precipitate out of urine and form stones (calculi) in the urinary tract.
Small stones are passed in the urine. However, big stones remain in the kidney (nephrolithiasis) impairing the outflow of urine while medium-size stones make their way from the kidney into the ureter and lodge there further blocking the flow of urine (urinary obstruction).  
Obstruction of the urinary tract puts pressure back up on the ureter and kidney. causing the ureter to widen (dilate) and the kidney to be compressed. Obstruction also causes the urine to be stagnant (not moving), an open invitation to repeated urinary tract infection. The pressure on the kidneys and the urinary infections results in damage to the kidneys. The damage can progress to renal insufficiency and end-stage kidney disease, requiring renal dialysis or a transplant.
The stone are responsible for all the signs and symptoms of cystinuria, including:
