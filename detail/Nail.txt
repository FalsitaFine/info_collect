Nail: In medicine, there are two types of nails. One is
just a plain old metal nail used to hold 2 or more pieces of bone together, for example,
after a fracture. The other type of nail is the horny plate on the end of the finger or
toe. Each nail anatomically has a body, lateral nail folds (on the sides), a lunula (the
little moon-shaped feature at the base), and a proximal skin fold (at the base).
