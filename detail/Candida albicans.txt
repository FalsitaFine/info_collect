Candida albicans: A yeast-like fungal organism 
found in small amounts in the normal human intestinal 
tract. Normally kept in check by the body's own helpful 
bacteria, C. albicans can increase in numbers when this 
balance is disturbed to cause candidiasis of the intestinal 
tract, or yeast infections of other parts of the body. C. 
albicans causes thrush. Also called Monilia albicans. See 
also Candidiasis.
