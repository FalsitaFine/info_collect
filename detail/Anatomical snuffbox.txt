Anatomical snuffbox: A hollow seen on the radial aspect (the thumbside) of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8802" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">dorsum</a> (the back) of the wrist when the thumb is extended fully. The reason that it is called the anatomical snuffbox is that snuff (powdered tobacco) could be put there and then inhaled.
