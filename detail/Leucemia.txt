Leucemia: A different spelling of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leukemia/article.htm">leukemia</a>, 
cancer of the blood cells. The growth and development of the blood 
cells are abnormal. Strictly speaking, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leukemia/article.htm">leukemia</a> should refer only to 
cancer of the white blood cells (the leukocytes) but in practice it 
can apply to malignancy of any cellular element in the blood or bone 
marrow, as in red cell leukemia (erythroleukemia).
