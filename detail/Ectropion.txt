Ectropion: a condition in which the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_diseases_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">eyelid</a> is turned out, away from the eyeball. The lower lid is most commonly affected. An ectropion exposes the inner surface of the eyelid and can lead to irritation and infection. Symptoms can include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_eyes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dry eyes</a>, a gritty feeling in the eyes, excessive tear production, and light sensitivity. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Conjunctivitis</a> (redness and inflammation of the lining tissues of the eyelid and outer eyeball) can accompany an ectropion. An ectropion may develop due to the normal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/senior_health/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">aging</a> process or may be present as a birth defect or a result of facial palsy or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_adhesions_scar_tissue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scar tissue</a>. Artificial tears may relieve symptoms, and surgery to tighten the eyelid muscles can be effective.
