Meuse fever: Named for the Meuse River area, one of the great battlegrounds of World War I. Also known as trench <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>.   Meuse or trench fever is a disease borne by body lice that was first recognized in the trenches of World War I, when it is estimated to have affected more than a million people in Russia and on the fronts in Europe. Trench fever was again a major problem in the military in World War II and is seen endemically in Mexico, Africa, E. Europe, and elsewhere.   Urban trench fever occurs among the homeless people and people   with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_abuse_and_alcoholism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">alcoholism</a> today. Outbreaks have been documented, for example,   in Seattle, Baltimore (among injection-drug users), Marseilles   (France) and Burundi.    The cause of trench fever is <i> Bartonella quintana </i> (also called   <i> Rochalimaea quintana</i>), an unusual  organism that   multiplies in the gut of the body louse. Transmission of the   bacteria to people can occur by rubbing infected louse feces into   abraded (scuffed) skin or into the conjunctivae (whites of the eyes).   The disease is classically a 5-day fever. The onset of symptoms is   sudden with high fever, severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a>, back pain and leg pain and a   fleeting <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a>.   Recovery takes a month or more. Relapses are common.  It is now clear, that at least in its urban form among the   homeless, trench fever can be associated with nonspecific symptoms or   no symptoms (New England Journal of Medicine 340: 184-189, 1999).  The organism <i>(B. quintana)</i> that causes trench fever also has been   found responsible for a disease called bacillary angiomatosis in   people infected with HIV and for infection of the heart and great   vessels (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endocarditis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">endocarditis</a>) with bloodstream infection.   Trench fever is also called Wolhynia fever, shin bone fever,   quintan   fever, five-day fever, His' disease, His-Werner   disease, Werner-His disease.
