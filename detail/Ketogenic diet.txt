The ketogenic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">diet</a> produces a reaction in the body that is similar to the fasting state, known a ketosis. With ketosis, substances known as ketones or ketone bodies accumulate in the blood. These are the same substances that accumulate during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetic_ketoacidosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ketoacidosis</a> in people with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_1_diabetes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">type 1 diabetes</a>. The ketogenic diet typically is not recommended for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight control</a>, because it is not superior to other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight management</a> plans and may be associated with health risks, including nutritional deficiencies. Also known as keto diet.
