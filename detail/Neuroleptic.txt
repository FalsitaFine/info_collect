Neuroleptic: A term that refers to the effects of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11993" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">antipsychotic</a> drugs on a patient, especially on his or her cognition and behavior. Neuroleptic drugs may produce a state of apathy, lack of initiative and limited range of emotion. In psychotic patients, neuroleptic drugs cause a reduction in confusion and agitation and tend to normalize psychomotor activity. The term comes from the Greek "lepsis" meaning a taking hold.
