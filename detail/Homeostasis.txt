Homeostasis: A property of cells, tissues, and organisms that allows the maintenance and regulation of the stability and constancy needed to function properly. Homeostasis is a healthy state that is maintained by the constant adjustment of biochemical and physiological pathways. An example of homeostasis is the maintenance of a constant blood pressure in the human body through a series of fine adjustments in the normal range of function of the hormonal,  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=34038" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">neuromuscular</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18311" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cardiovascular</a> systems. These adjustments allow the maintenance of blood pressure needed for body function despite environmental changes and changes in a person's activity level and position. Other homeostatic mechanisms, for example, permit the maintenance of body temperature within a narrow range.
