characterized by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm">abdominal pain</a>, bloating, mucous in stools, and irregular bowel 
habits with alternating
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm">diarrhea</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm">constipation</a>, symptoms that tend to be chronic and to wax 
and wane over the
years. Although the  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colitis/article.htm">spastic colitis</a> can cause chronic recurrent discomfort, it does 
not lead to any
serious organ problems. 
Making the diagnosis usually involves excluding other 
illnesses. Treatment is
directed toward relief of symptoms and includes changes in diet (eating high <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fiber/article.htm">fiber</a> and avoiding caffeine, milk products and sweeteners),  
exercise, relaxation
techniques, and 
medications.
