ABO blood group: The major human <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2485" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">blood group</a> system. The ABO type of a person depends on the presence or absence of two genes, A and B. These genes determine the configuration of the red blood cell surface. A person who has two A genes or an A and an O gene has red blood cells of type A. A person who has two B genes or one B and one O gene has red cells of type B. If the person has one A and one B gene, the red cells are type AB. If the person has neither the A nor the B gene, the red cells are type O. It is essential to match the ABO status of both donor and recipient in blood transfusions and organ transplants.
