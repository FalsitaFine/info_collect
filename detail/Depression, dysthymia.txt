Depression, dysthymia: A type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm">depression</a> involving long-term, chronic symptoms that are not disabling, but keep a person from functioning at "full
steam" or from feeling good. Dysthymia is a less severe type of depression than what is accorded the diagnosis of major depression. However, people with dysthymia may also sometimes experience major depressive episodes, suggesting that there is a continuum between dysthymia and major depression.
