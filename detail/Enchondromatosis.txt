Enchondromatosis: A condition characterized by multiple enchondromas -- benign masses of cartilage growing within bones. The enchondromas can deform and shorten a limb and predispose to a fracture. The condition can be caused by a mutation in the gene for the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR1). Also known as Ollier disease.
