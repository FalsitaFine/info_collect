Dyscrasia: Any disease condition, especially in hematology, as in "blood dyscrasias." The term "dyscrasia" was borrowed from the Greek meaning "a bad mixture" referring to the ancient belief that an imbalance between the four humors - blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile- which caused disease.
