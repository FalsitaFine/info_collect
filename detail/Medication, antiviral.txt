Medication, antiviral: An drug that kills viruses or suppresses their replication and, hence, inhibits their capability to multiply and reproduce. For example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amantadine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">amantadine</a> (Symmetrel) is a synthetic (man-made) drug that inhibits the multiplication of the influenza A virus and was once used to prevent the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">flu</a>. Safer medicines such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/oseltamivir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">oseltamivir</a> (Tamiflu) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/zanamivir/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">zanamivir</a> (Relenza) can be used to prevent the flu shortly after exposure or to reduce the severity.    Flu antiviral drugs work best for treatment when they are started within 2 days of getting sick. However, starting them later can still be helpful, especially if the sick person has a high risk health condition or is very sick from the flu. (Neither drug is a substitute for flu shots).
