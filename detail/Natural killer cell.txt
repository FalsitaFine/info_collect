Natural killer cell: A cell that can react against and destroy another cell without prior sensitization to it. Abbreviated NK cell. NK cells are part of our first line of defense against <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> cells and virus-infected cells. NK cells are small lymphocytes that originate in the bone marrow and develop without the influence of the thymus. An NK cell attaches to a target cell, releases chemicals that breach its cell wall, and causes it to lyse (break up).
