Mutation: A permanent change, a structural alteration, in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3090">DNA</a> or 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5382">RNA</a>. In humans and many other organisms, mutations occur in DNA. However, in retroviruses like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3769">HIV</a>, mutations occur in RNA which is the genetic material of retroviruses.    
In most cases, such changes are neutral and have no effect or they are deleterious and cause harm, but occasionally a mutation can improve an organism's chance of surviving and of passing the beneficial change on to its descendants. Mutations are the necessary raw material of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3341">evolution</a>.
