Fiber FISH: A cytogenetic (chromosome) laboratory technique in which FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) is done on chromosomes that have been mechanically stretched. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fiber/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">Fiber</a> FISH provides a higher resolution of analysis than conventional FISH and yields more precise information as to the localization of a specific DNA probe on the chromosome.
The word "fiber" here refers not to dietary fiber but to a chromosome fiber.
