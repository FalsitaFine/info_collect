Circulation, fetal: The blood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2735" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">circulation</a> in the fetus (an unborn baby). Before birth, blood from the fetal heart that is destined for the lungs is shunted away from the lungs through a short vessel called the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3128" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">ductus arteriosus</a> and returned to the aorta. When this shunt is open, it is said to be a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4798" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">patent ductus arteriosus</a> (PDA). The PDA usually closes at or shortly after birth, allowing blood to course freely to the lungs.
