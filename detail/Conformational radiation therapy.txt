Conformational radiation therapy: A procedure that uses computers to create a 3-dimensional picture of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> in order to target the tumor as accurately as possible and give it the highest possible dose of radiation while sparing normal tissue as much as possible. It is also known as 3-D or conformal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/radiation_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">radiation therapy</a>. 
Conventional radiation therapy directs x-rays not only at the tumor but also unavoidably at nearby healthy tissue. Conformational radiation is meant to deliver a higher dose of radiation to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> without causing so much damage to surrounding tissues.

Conformational radiation therapy is in use to treat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prostate_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">prostate cancer</a> and is under study with other types of cancer including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lung cancer</a>, brain tumors and cancer of the head and neck.
