Fever, epidemic hemorrhagic: A 
number of diseases characterized by an abrupt onset of high 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm"> fever</a> and chills, headache, cold and cough, and pain in the 
muscles, joints and abdomen with nausea and vomiting 
followed by  bleeding into the kidney and elsewhere. Known 
also as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. 

Many arboviruses (including those in the families Togaviridae, 
Flaviviridae, Filoviridae, and Bunyaviridae) and the 
Hantaviruses, spread by rodents or biting insects, can 
cause epidemic hemorrhagic fever. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ebola_hemorrhagic_fever_ebola_hf/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Ebola virus</a> is a 
notorious cause of epidemic hemorrhagic fever.

<u>Bioterrorism</u> -- There has been concern about the hemorrhagic fever as a possible weapon for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18548">bioterrorism</a>. However, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of the US Congress, in a 1999 report considered hemorrhagic fever to be an "unlikely" biologic threat for terrorism, because these viruses are very difficult to obtain and process, unsafe to handle, and relatively unstable. The lethal effects of these viruses were deemed by the GAO to depend on the strain but can be "very high."
