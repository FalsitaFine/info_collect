Mast cell: A granulocyte found in connective tissue whose normal function is unknown but that is frequently injured during allergic reactions. When a mast cell is injured, it releases strong chemicals, including histamine, into the tissues and blood. These chemicals are very irritating and cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itching</a>, swelling, and fluid leaking from cells. They can also cause muscle spasm, leading to lung and throat tightening (as is found in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">asthma</a>) and loss of voice.
