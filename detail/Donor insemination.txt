Donor insemination:  A procedure in which a fine 
catheter (tube) is
inserted
through the cervix (the natural opening of the uterus) 
into the uterus (the
womb) to deposit a sperm sample from a man other than the 
woman's mate
directly into the uterus. The purpose of this procedure is 
to achieve
fertilization and pregnancy. Donor insemination is also 
called artificial
insemination by donor (AID) or heterologous  insemination. 
It is to be
distinguished from artificial insemination by husband 
(AIH) which is
homologous insemination.
