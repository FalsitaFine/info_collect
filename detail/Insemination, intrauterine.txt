Insemination, intrauterine:  A procedure in which 
a fine catheter (tube) is
inserted through the cervix (the natural opening of the 
uterus) into the
uterus (the womb) to deposit a sperm sample directly into 
the uterus. The
purpose of intrauterine insemination (IUI) is to achieve 
fertilization and
pregnancy. IUI is a relatively simple procedure. 
"Intrauterine" is within
the uterus. "Insemination" is from "in-" + "semen," seed = 
seed in. So,
"intrauterine insemination" = seed in the uterus. 
Intrauterine insemination
is also called artificial insemination.
