Cancer survivor: Someone who has received the diagnosis of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>. Others would say one is survivor only if they had a potentially fatal    form of cancer and is therefore forced to face his or her own mortality. Still others today use the term to describe a person who has completed all of their anticancer therapy and presently shows no sign of the disease- that is, is in remission, and now must go on a face survival with both fear of recurrence and perhaps encumbered by the side effects and consequences of their therapies.
