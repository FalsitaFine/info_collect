Colorblindness: The inability to perceive colors in a normal fashion. The most common forms of colorblindness are inherited as sex-linked (X-linked) recessive traits. Females are carriers and males are affected. As a result, approximately 1 in 8 males is colorblind as compared to less than 1 in 100 females.
