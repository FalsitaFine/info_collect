Dropsy: An old term for the swelling of soft tissues due to the accumulation of excess water.
In years gone by, a person might have been said to have dropsy. Today one would be more descriptive and specify the cause. Thus, the person might have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">edema</a> due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/congestive_heart_failure_chf_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">congestive heart failure</a>.   Edema is often more prominent in the lower legs and feet toward the end of the day as a result of pooling of fluid from the upright position usually maintained during the day. Upon awakening from sleeping, people can have swelling around the eyes referred to as periorbital edema.
The Middle English dropesie came through the Old French hydropsie from the Greek hydrops which in turn came from the Greek "hydro" meaning water.
