Macular pucker: Scar tissue in the macula, the area of the retina responsible for sharp central vision. The scar can blur and distort vision and make straight lines appear wavy. Macular pucker is due most often to age-related shrinkage of the vitreous which pulls away from the retina, causing the retina to scar and wrinkle. Other causes of macular pucker include trauma (from surgery or an eye injury), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/retinal_detachment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">retinal detachment</a>, inflammation, and problems with the retinal blood vessels. The only treatment is surgery which consists of a vitrectomy (removal of the vitreous) combined with peeling away of the scar tissue. Most patients recover about half of their lost vision, and distortion is significantly reduced. The most common complication of vitrectomy is an increase in the rate of cataract development. Also called epiretinal membrane, retinal wrinkling, premacular fibrosis, and cellophane maculopathy.
