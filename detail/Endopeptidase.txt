Endopeptidase: An enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of peptide bonds within a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7766" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">polypeptide</a> or protein. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33421" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Peptidase</a> refers to the fact that it acts on peptide bonds and endopeptidase refers to the fact that these are internal bonds. An exopeptide catalyzes the cleavage of the terminal or penultimate peptide bond, releasing a single amino acid or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=39554" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">dipeptide</a> from the peptide chain.
