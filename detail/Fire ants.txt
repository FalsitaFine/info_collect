Fire ants: Originally from S. America. Among the worst
insect pests ever to invade the US. Red or yellowish ants of small-to-medium size with a
severe sting that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/burns/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">burns</a> like fire. They normally feed on small insects but, with denser
populations, they eat seeds and seedling plants, damage grain and vegetable crops, invade
kitchens, attack newly hatched poultry and the young of ground-nesting wild birds. Fire
ants can kill newborn domestic and wild animals. Each colony is composed of a queen,
winged males and females and 3 kinds of workers. A nest averages about 25,000 workers, but
far larger populations are common. Semipermanent nests are large mounds of excavated soil
with openings for ventilation. Since nests may number 50-100 (or more) in a heavily
infested field, cultivating becomes difficult (or impossible). Fire ants belong to the
genus Solenopsis. The severe sting of this ant causes a pustule to form within 24 hours that takes 10-14 days to resolve. Fire ant toxin can trigger an allergic reaction, particularly in people allergic to bee, wasp and yellowjacket stings.  Avoidance and prompt treatment are essential.
