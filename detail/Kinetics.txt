Kinetics: Kinetics (with an "s" at the end) 
refers to the rate of change in
a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15510">biochemical</a> (or other) reaction, the study of reaction 
rates. Kinetics is
a noun. It is distinct from "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7308">kinetic</a>"  (an adjective) 
meaning with movement.
The opposite of kinetic is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6989">akinetic</a> meaning without 
movement. In <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=16313">neurology</a>, kinetic and 
akinetic serve to denote the presence or absence of movement. Kinetic comes from 
the Greek word "kinesis" for motion. The term "akinetic" is put together from 
the prefix "a-" meaning "without" + "kinesis" =
         
  
          
 
            
 
without motion. Kinesis is verbatim from the Greek 
"kinesis."
