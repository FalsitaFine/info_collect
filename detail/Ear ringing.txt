Ear ringing: Together with other abnormal ear noises, ear ringing is medically called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tinnitus_ringing_in_the_ears/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tinnitus</a>. It is a symptom of a problem, not a disease. Tinnitus may be due to many causes including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_infection/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ear infection</a>, fluid in the ears, Ménière's syndrome,  medications such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aging, and ear trauma (such as from the noise of planes, firearms, or loud music). In rare situations, tinnitus may reflect an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_aneurysm/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">aneurysm</a> or an acoustic neuroma (a benign <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> on the acoustic nerve). Woodwind players are more likely to experience tinnitus than other orchestral players, probably because they usually sit just in front of the brass. If tinnitus persists a hearing test (audiogram) should be done. Sometimes, measures can be taken to lessen the intensity of tinnitus or to mask it.
