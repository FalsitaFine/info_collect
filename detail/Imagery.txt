Imagery: Both a mental process (as in 
imagining) and a wide variety of procedures used in therapy 
to encourage changes in attitudes, behavior, or 
physiological reactions. As a mental process, it is often 
defined as "any thought representing a sensory quality." It 
includes, as well as the visual, all the senses - aural, 
tactile, olfactory, proprioceptive, and kinesthetic.

Imagery has been successfully tested as a strategy for 
alleviating nausea and vomiting associated with

facilitate weight gain in cancer patients. It has been 
successfully used and tested for pain control in a variety 
of settings; as adjunctive therapy for several diseases, 
including diabetes; and with geriatric patients to enhance 
immunity.

Imagery is usually combined with other behavioral 
approaches. It is best known in the treatment of cancer as 
a means to help patients mobilize their immune systems, but 
it also is used as part of a multidisciplinary approach to 
cardiac rehabilitation and in many settings that specialize 
in treating chronic pain.
