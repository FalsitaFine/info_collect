Human chorionic gonadotropin:  (hCG) A human <a href="https://www.medicinenet.comhttps://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm3">hormone</a> made by chorionic cells in the fetal part of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4918">placenta</a>. Human chorionic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11384">gonadotropin</a> (hCG) is directed at the gonads and stimulates them. Hence, the name "gonadotropin." 

The presence of hCG is detectable by immunologic means within days of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3413">fertilization</a> and forms the foundation of the common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11893">pregnancy</a> tests. The level of hCG tends to be higher with a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3408">female</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3424">fetus</a> soon after conception.  

The level of hCG in maternal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5470">serum</a> also
enters as one component in the "double" and the "triple" screening tests used
during pregnancy to assign risks of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3112">Down syndrome</a> and other fetal disorders.
