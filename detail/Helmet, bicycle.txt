Helmet, bicycle: A well-known but often neglected device designed to protect the head of a bicyclist.
Helmets decrease the risk of head injuries (traumatic brain damage) by about 85%. Unfortunately, only about 18% of bicyclists in the US use helmets all or most of the time. Universal helmet use could prevent an average of 500 bicycle-related deaths each year in the US alone.
