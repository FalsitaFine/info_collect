Enteritis, regional: Crohn's disease by another
name, a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine primarily in the small and large
intestines but which can occur anywhere in the digestive system between the mouth and the
anus. Named after Burrill Crohn who described the disease in 1932. The disease usually
affects persons in their <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teenagers/article.htm">teens</a> or early twenties. It tends to be a chronic, recurrent
condition with periods of remission and exacerbation. In the early stages, Crohn's
disease causes small scattered shallow crater-like areas (erosions) called aphthous ulcers
in the inner surface of the bowel. With time, deeper and larger ulcers develop, causing
scarring and stiffness of the bowel and the bowel becomes increasingly narrowed, leading
to obstruction. Deep ulcers can puncture holes in the bowel wall, leading to infection in
the abdominal cavity (peritonitis) and in adjacent organs. When only the large intestine
(colon) is involved, the condition is called Crohn's colitis. When only the small
intestine is involved, the condition is called Crohn's enteritis. When only the end
of the small intestine (the terminal ileum) is involved, it is termed terminal ileitis.
When both the small intestine and the large intestine are involved, the condition is
called Crohn's enterocolitis (or ileocolitis). <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm">Abdominal pain</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm">diarrhea</a>, vomiting,
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm"> fever</a>, and weight loss can be symptoms. Crohn's disease can be associated with
reddish tender skin nodules, and inflammation of the joints, spine, eyes, and liver.
Diagnosis is by barium enema, barium x-ray of the small bowel, and colonoscopy. Treatment
includes medications for inflammation, immune suppression, antibiotics, or surgery. (The
disease is also called granulomatous enteritis).
