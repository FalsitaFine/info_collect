Detailed images of internal organs are obtained by this type of sophisticated X-ray device. CT stands for computed tomography. The CT scan can reveal anatomic details of internal organs that cannot be seen in conventional X-rays. The X-ray tube spins rapidly around the patient and the X-rays strike numerous detectors after passing through the body. These detectors are connected to sophisticated computers which generate images after image processing. The radiation dose of a CT scanner is much higher than a conventional X-ray, but the information obtained from a CT scan is often much greater.
