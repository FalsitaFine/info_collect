Arrhythmia: An abnormal heart rhythm. 
In an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arrhythmia_irregular_heartbeat/article.htm">arrhythmia</a> the heartbeats may be too
slow, too rapid, too irregular, or too early. Rapid arrhythmias (greater than 100 beats per
minute) are called tachycardias. Slow arrhythmias (slower than 60 beats per minute) are
called bradycardias. Irregular heart rhythms are called fibrillations (as in atrial
fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation). When a single heartbeat occurs earlier than normal, it is called a
premature contraction.
The term arrhythmia comes from the Greek a-, loss + rhythmos, rhythm = loss of rhythm.
