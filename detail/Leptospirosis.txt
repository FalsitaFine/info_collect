Leptospirosis: An infectious disease caused by
a particular type of bacteria called a spirochete transmitted by rats as well as by skunks, opossums, raccoons, foxes, and other vermin. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leptospirosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Leptospirosis</a> occurs worldwide but is most commonly
acquired in the tropics.  About 100 cases of leptospirosis
are reported each year in the US. The disease is becoming a greater risk as more people travel to undeveloped areas of the world. (Athletes who participated in the Eco-Challenge-Sabah 2000 multisport expedition in Borneo, Malaysia, in August 2000 contracted leptospirosis after coming in contact with the Segama River.).
