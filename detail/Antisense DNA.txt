Antisense DNA: DNA normally has two strands, i.e., the sense strand and the antisense strand. In double-stranded DNA, only one strand codes for the RNA that is translated into protein. This DNA strand is referred to as the antisense strand. The strand that does not code for RNA is called the sense strand. Another way of defining antisense DNA is that it is the strand of DNA that carries the information necessary to make proteins by binding to a corresponding <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4357" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">messenger RNA</a>. Although these strands are exact mirror images of one another, only the antisense strand contains the information for making proteins. The sense strand does not.Antisense DNA is also known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=20821" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">noncoding DNA</a>.
