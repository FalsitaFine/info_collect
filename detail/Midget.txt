Midget: A very small person (or thing). Midget is a picturesque but somewhat disparaging term. It is the diminutive of midge (the insect), and who wants to be a mini-midge? A more correct term today for a very small person is dwarf or little person.
The notion that a midget is (as some dictionaries state) a "normal dwarf, a person who is unusually short...but is not deformed" is incorrect.
