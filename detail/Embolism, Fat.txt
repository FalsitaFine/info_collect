Embolism, fat: A process by which fat tissue passes into the bloodstream and lodges within a blood vessel. In general, an embolus is something that travels through the bloodstream, lodges in a blood vessel, and blocks it.  A fat embolus is a fat particle or droplet that travels through the circulation and eventually blocks a blood vessel. Fat emboli tend to be small and multiple, causing numerous signs and symptoms.
