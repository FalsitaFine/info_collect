<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/angina_symptoms/article.htm">Angina</a>, Vincent:  This is trench mouth, a 
progressive painful infection with ulceration, swelling  and 
sloughing off of dead tissue from the mouth and throat due to the 
spread of infection from the gums. 

Certain germs (including fusiform bacteria and 
spirochetes) have been thought to be involved, but the full 
story behind this long-known disease is still not clear.  

This condition is also called Vincent (or Vincent's) angina after the French 
physician Henri Vincent (1862-1950). The word "angina" comes from the 
Latin "angere" meaning "to choke or throttle."

As with most poorly understood diseases, Vincent angina goes by 
many other names including acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis 
(ANUG), acute membranous gingivitis, fusospirillary gingivitis, 
fusospirillosis, fusospirochetal gingivitis,  necrotizing gingivitis, 
phagedenic gingivitis, ulcerative gingivitis, Vincent stomatitis, 
Vincent gingivitis, and Vincent infection.
