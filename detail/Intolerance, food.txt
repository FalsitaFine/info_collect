Intolerance, food: Difficulty in digesting a food. Common offenders include milk products, wheat and other grains that contain gluten, and foods that tend to cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/intestinal_gas_belching_bloating_flatulence/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">intestinal gas</a>, such as cabbage and beans. Food intolerance is often mistaken for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/food_allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">food allergy</a>, but it does not involve a histamine response against the food. Treatments include avoiding the offending food and taking supplemental products that allow that food to be adequately digested.
