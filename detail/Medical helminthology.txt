Medical helminthology: The field of medicine that pertains to helminths (worms) capable of disease in people. For more about these worms, see "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=12321">Helminth</a>."

The public health impact of medical helminths is appreciable. Two billion people are infected by soil-transmitted helminths such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2361">Ascaris</a>, hookworms, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=12961">Trichuris trichiura</a> and by schistosomes.  Early <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=16600">childhood</a> infections by soil-transmitted helminths delays physical and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15297">cognitive</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2964">development</a>. Other widespread helminthic infections include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11977">onchocerciasis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=14970">lymphatic filariasis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=16121">dracunculiasis</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/guinea_worm_disease/article.htm">Guinea worm disease</a>), and food-borne trematode and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5713">tapeworm</a> infections. All of these infections cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2728">chronic</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4430">morbidity</a> and debilitation.
Medical helminths need to develop in a parasitized host, and sometimes this involves several disparate hosts. Helminth parasites are more complex than free-living helminths, because they have evolved mechanisms to deal with the different environments of their various hosts and living conditions. They have developed host-finding behaviors, exquisite migration patterns within each host, and the ability to evade the host <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3905">immune</a> and protective responses.
