Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome: An immune disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal antibodies in the blood associated with abnormal blood clotting, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">migraine</a> headaches, recurrent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a> losses (repeat spontaneous abortions), and low blood platelet counts (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thrombocytopenia_low_platelet_count/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">thrombocytopenia</a>). The abnormal antibodies are directed against phospholipids. (Phospholipids are fats that contains phosphorous). APLS can occur by itself (primary) or be caused by an underlying condition (secondary), such as systemic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/systemic_lupus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lupus</a> erythematosus. About a third of persons with primary APLS have heart valve abnormalities.
Antiphospholipid antibodies reduce the levels of annexin V, a protein that binds phospholipids and has potent anticoagulant activity. The reduction of annexin V levels is thought to be a possible mechanism underlying the increased tendency of blood to clot and the propensity to pregnancy loss characteristic of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
