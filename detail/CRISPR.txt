CRISPR (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats):  repeating sequences of genetic material in certain single-celled organisms. These segments of genetic material, along certain enzymes, constitute the basis of a gene editing system, which is also referred to as "CRISPR" (pronounced "crisper"). This technology can be used to target and edit specific stretches of genetic code, permitting the modification of genes in living cells. The technology has the potential in the future to correct mutations at precise locations in the human genome to treat genetic causes of disease.
