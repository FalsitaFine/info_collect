Bulimia susceptibility gene: A gene that determines the susceptibility to developing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bulimia_nervosa/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bulimia</a>, one disorder in the spectrum of eating disorders. There is now a substantial literature showing that bulimia is strongly familial and that the pronounced familial nature of bulimia is due largely to the additive effects of a number of genes. One bulimia susceptibility gene is known to be linked to chromosome 10p (the short arm of chromosome 10). Another susceptibility gene for bulimia may be on chromosome 14.
