Cold, June:  A popular term for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3656">hay fever</a>. Although the symptoms of a "June cold" may be quite similar to those of a real <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7808">cold</a>, the term "June cold" is a misnomer. Unlike 
a real cold, it is not caused by a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5997">virus</a>, but by allergy. It is therefore also known as allergic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5359">rhinitis</a>, a runny nose due to an allergy.
