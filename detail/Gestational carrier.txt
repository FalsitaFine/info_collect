Gestational carrier: Also known as gestational surrogate. A woman who carries 
a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm">pregnancy</a> and gives birth to a child for another woman or couple. For a woman 
to serve as a gestational carrier, an embryo (created by the process of in vitro 
fertilization) is implanted in her uterus. The gestational carrier has no 
biological relationship to the embryo she is carrying. The IVF process used to 
create the embryo can use egg and sperm from the intended parents, or donor 
egg/sperm may be used in either case.
