Epilepsy (seizure disorder): When
nerve cells in the brain fire electrical impulses at a rate of up to four times higher
than normal, this causes a sort of electrical storm in the brain, known as a seizure. A
pattern of repeated seizures is referred to as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizure/article.htm">epilepsy</a>. Known causes include head
injuries, brain tumors, lead poisoning, maldevelopment of the brain, genetic and
infectious illnesses. But in fully half of cases, no cause can be found. Medication
controls seizures for the majority of patients.
