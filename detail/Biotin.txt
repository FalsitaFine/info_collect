Biotin: A water-soluble B-complex vitamin involved in carbon dioxide transfer and therefore essential to the metabolism of carbohydrate and fat. A balanced diet usually contains enough biotin. Foods with high biotin levels include nuts, cereals, green leafy vegetables and milk.  Biotin deficiency, which is characterized by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hair loss</a> and a scaly red <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a>, can occur with prolonged intravenous feeding or the frequent consumption of raw egg whites which contain a biotin antagonist called avidin. Biotin supplementation is recommended during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a> because the biotin requirement rises during pregnancy and a substantial number of pregnant women become biotin depleted. Extra biotin is also needed during long-term anticonvulsant treatment which depletes biotin.
