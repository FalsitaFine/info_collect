Ipecac: A naturally occurring substance with multiple properties including the ability to cause vomiting (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3227" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">emesis</a>).  Ipecac is derived from dried roots of a bush called Uragoga ipecacuanha that is native to Brazil. In the past, a sizable proportion of poison exposures in the U.S. were treated with ipecac. This practice has dropped off and some experts recommend that it should be abandoned, except in rare instances.
