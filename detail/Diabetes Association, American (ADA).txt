"The American Diabetes Association is the nation's leading nonprofit health organization providing diabetes research, information and advocacy. Founded in 1940, it was reorganized in 1969 to increase its ability to serve the public. Today, offices in more than 800 communities conduct programs in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
"The mission of the organization is to prevent and cure diabetes, and to improve the lives of all people affected by diabetes. To fulfill this mission, the American Diabetes Association funds research, publishes scientific findings, and provides information and other services to people with diabetes, their families, health care professionals and the public."
