Knee, secretary's: The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/patellofemoral_syndrome/article.htm">patellofemoral syndrome</a> 
(PFS), the commonest cause of
chronic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/knee_pain_facts/article.htm">knee pain</a>. PFS characteristically causes vague 
discomfort of the
inner knee area, aggravated by activity (running, jumping, 
climbing or
descending stairs) or by prolonged sitting with knees in a 
moderately bent
position (the so-called "theater sign" of pain upon 
arising from a desk or
theater seat).  The knee may be mildly swollen. If chronic 
symptoms are
ignored, the loss of quadriceps strength may cause the leg 
to "give out."
