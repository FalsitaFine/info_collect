Symptoms at birth may include muscle stiffness (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3850" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">hypertonia</a>), an exaggerated response to being startled, and strong brain stem reflexes (especially head-retraction reflex). The startle reflex is sometimes accompanied by sudden stiffness (acute generalized hypertonia), which can cause the affected person to fall to the ground like a log. Treatment is via medications.
