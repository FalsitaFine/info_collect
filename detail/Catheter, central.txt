Catheter, central: A catheter (a tube) that is passed through a vein to end up in the thoracic (chest) portion of the vena cava (the large vein returning blood to the heart) or in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=26566" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">right atrium</a> of the heart. 
Central catheters have a diversity of uses. They allow concentrated solutions to be infused with less risk of complications. They permit monitoring of the central venous pressure, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=24368" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">pulmonary artery</a> pressure, and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. They can be used for the estimation of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7524" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cardiac output</a> and vascular resistance. The near end of the catheter may also be connected to a chamber for injections given over periods of months.
