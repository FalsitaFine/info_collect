Head lice are most often found on the scalp behind the ears and near the neckline at the back of the neck. The lice hold onto the hair with hook-like claws at the end of each of their six legs. Head lice are rarely found on the body, eyelashes, or eyebrows. These insects lay their sticky, white eggs on the hair shaft close to the root, while hatched lice stay mostly on the scalp. Head lice infection is very common and easily acquired by coming in close contact with someone who has head lice, infested clothing, or infested belongings. Preschool and elementary school children and their families are most often infested.
