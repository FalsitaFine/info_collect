Legg-Calve-Perthes disease: A hip disorder in children due to interruption of the blood supply to the head of the femur (the ball in the ball-and-socket hip joint), causing it to deteriorate. The disease is most common at age 6 to 9, tends to affect boys, but is more severe in girls. It can be familial. The symptoms include hip and thigh pain, stiff hip, a limp, and diminution in size of the thigh. Over a period of 18 to 24 months the blood supply usually reestablishes itself. During this period, the bone is soft and liable to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/broken_bone_types_of_bone_fractures/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fracture</a> under pressure, causing collapse of the head of the femur. Treatment may include casting, bracing, surgery and physical therapy. Also known as Legg, Legg-Perthes and Perthes disease and avascular necrosis of the femoral head.
