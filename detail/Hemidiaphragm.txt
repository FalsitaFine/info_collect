Hemidiaphragm: Half of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9758">diaphragm</a>, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4464">muscle</a> that separates the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=19270">chest</a> cavity from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2081">abdomen</a> and that serves as the main muscle of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5328">respiration</a>. Both hemidiaphragms are visible on <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6032">X-ray</a> studies from the front or back. 
The right hemidiaphragm is protected by the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4179">liver</a> and is stronger than the left. 
The left hemidiaphragm is more often subject to rupture and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3726">hernia</a> than the right. This may also reflect weaknesses at the points of embryologic fusion of the left hemidiaphragm.
