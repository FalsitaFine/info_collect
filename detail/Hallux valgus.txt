Hallux valgus: A condition in which the big toe (hallux) is bent outward (toward the midline of the foot; valgus) so that it overlaps the second toe. Hallux valgus may be accompanied by a bunion (localized painful swelling) and is frequently associated with inflammation. It can be related to inflammation of the nearby bursa (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acute_and_chronic_bursitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bursitis</a>) or degenerative joint disease (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoarthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">osteoarthritis</a>).
