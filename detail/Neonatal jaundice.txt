Neonatal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/jaundice_in_adults/article.htm">jaundice</a>:   Yellowish 
staining of the skin and whites of the newborn's eyes 
(sclerae) by pigment of bile (bilirubin).  In newborn 
babies a degree of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/jaundice_in_adults/article.htm">jaundice</a> is normal. It is due to the 
breakdown of red blood cells (which release bilirubin into 
the blood)  and to the immaturity of the newborn's liver 
(which cannot effectively metabolize the bilirubin and 
prepare it for excretion into the urine). Normal neonatal 
jaundice typically appears between the 2nd and 5th days of 
life and clears with time. Neonatal jaundice is also referred to as neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and physiologic jaundice of the newborn.
