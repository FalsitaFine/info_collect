In color hearing a musical tone elicits a color. One well-studied case involved an art teacher who had a range of consistent linkages between tone and color. For her, high octaves tended to evoke a lighter color value, while lower octaves evoked a darker color value. And rapid major chord tone sequences elicited rapid flashes of colors, "somewhat like fireworks exploding." Ref.: Haack, P. A., &amp; Radocy, R. E. (1981). A case study of a chromesthetic.
