Child abuse: A complex set of behaviors that include child neglect and the physical, emotional, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sexual_sex_problems_in_men/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sexual</a> abuse of children. Although most people think first of physical abuse when they hear the term <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/child_abuse_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">child abuse</a>, physical abuse makes up only a small percentage of reported cases. Physical abuse is defined as physical injury inflicted upon the child with cruel and/or malicious intent, although the law recognizes that in some cases the parent or caretaker may not have intended to hurt the child; rather, the injury may have resulted from excessive discipline or physical punishment. Physical abuse includes punching, beating, kicking, biting, burning, shaking, or otherwise physically harming a child. Injuries that can be fatal include severe head trauma, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/shaken_baby_syndrome_abusive_head_trauma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">shaken baby syndrome</a>, trauma to the abdomen or chest, scalding, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/burns/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">burns</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/drowning/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">drowning</a>, suffocation, and poisoning. Child abuse should always be reported, investigated, and stopped.
