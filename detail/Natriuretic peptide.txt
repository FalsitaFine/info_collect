Natriuretic peptide: One of the peptides that causes natriuresis, the excretion of an excessively large amount of sodium in the urine. The natriuretic peptides are produced by the heart and vasculature:
<ul>
<li>A-type natriuretic peptide is secreted largely by the atrial myocardium in response to dilatation. <li>B-type natriuretic peptide is manufactured mainly by the ventricular myocardium. <li>C-type natriuretic peptide is produced by endothelial cells that line the blood vessels.

B-type natriuretic peptide is useful in the diagnosis of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart failure</a>. The finding of a low level of B-type natriuretic peptide tends to exclude heart failure.
