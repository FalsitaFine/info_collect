Cancer, breast, susceptibility genes: Inherited factors that
predispose to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_facts_stages/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breast cancer</a>. Put otherwise, these genes make one more susceptible to the
disease and so increase the risk of developing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breast</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>. Two of these genes, BRCA1
and BRCA2, have been identified (and prominently publicized). Several other genes (those
for the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden disease, Muir-Torre syndrome, and
ataxia-telangiectasia) are also known to predispose to breast cancer. However, since all
of these known breast cancer susceptibility genes together do not account for more than a
minor fraction (1/5<sup>th</sup> at most) of breast cancer that clusters in families, it
is clear that more breast cancer genes remain to be discovered.
