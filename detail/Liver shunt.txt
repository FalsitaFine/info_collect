Liver shunt: Transjugular, intrahepatic, portosystemic shunt (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/transjugular_intrahepatic_portosystemic_shunt/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">TIPS</a>), is a shunt (tube) placed between the portal vein which carries blood from the intestines to the liver and the hepatic vein which carries blood from the liver back to the heart. It is used primarily (but not
exclusively) in patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cirrhosis</a> in which the scar tissue within the liver has blocked the flow of blood passing through the liver from the portal vein to the hepatic vein. The blockage increases the pressure in the portal vein leading to an increase in pressure in the portal vein (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/portal_hypertension/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">portal hypertension</a>). As a result of the increase in pressure, blood flows around the liver via small, unimportant veins that connect the portal vein with other veins within the abdomen. These veins enlarge and are referred to as varices.
