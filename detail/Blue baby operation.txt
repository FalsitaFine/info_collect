Blue baby operation: A surgical procedure for a baby  who is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23457" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cyanotic</a> (blue) due to a heart malformation that prevents blood from being fully oxygenated. The bluish color reflects the deoxygenated state of the blood. The surgery is designed to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4735" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">palliate</a> or ideally correct the heart defect and relieve the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10671" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cyanosis</a>.     The term originated with a pioneering heart operation named after the surgeon Dr. Alfred Blalock (1899-1964) and the children's heart specialist Dr. Helen Taussig (1898-1986). Dr. Taussig designed the first blue baby operation and Dr. Blalock performed it. The operation was done to treat a child with a previously inoperable heart malformation called the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=19210" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">tetralogy of Fallot</a>. The surgical procedure joined an artery leaving the heart to an artery leading to the lungs to give the blood a second chance at <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11807" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">oxygenation</a>. The joining (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2236" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">anastomosis</a>) was of the subclavian artery to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=24368" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">pulmonary artery</a>. It was the first <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=24529" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">blue baby</a> operation and came to be known as the Blalock-Taussig shunt.  This operation, which was done on November 29, 1944 at   the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, is a major landmark in the history of children's heart surgery.
