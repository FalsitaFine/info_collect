Monochromatism: 1) Total inability to perceive 
color. A person with true monochromatism perceives only 
black, white, and shades of gray. It is due to lack of or 
damage to the cones of the eye that perceive color, or to 
inability of the nerves to translate information received 
from the cones. Complete monochromatism is usually an 
inherited condition. 2) One of the many types of 
colorblindness that affects perception of certain colors 
only.
