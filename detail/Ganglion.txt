Ganglion:  The celebrated 2nd century Greek physician Galen ((c. 130-201 A.D.) who lived and worked in Rome first used the word <i>ganglion</i> to denote a nerve complex. Ganglion still is used to refer to an aggregation of
nerve cell bodies. Another use of the word <i>ganglion</i> is for a tendon cyst that most commonly pops up near the wrist.
