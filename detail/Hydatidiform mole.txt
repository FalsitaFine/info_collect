Hydatidiform <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/moles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">moles</a> occur during the childbearing years, and they do not spread outside the uterus.

Treatment includes removal of the mole by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dilation_and_curettage/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">dilation and curettage</a> (D &amp; C) and suction evacuation and surgery to remove the uterus (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hysterectomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">hysterectomy</a>).
