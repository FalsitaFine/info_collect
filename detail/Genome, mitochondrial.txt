Genome, mitochondrial: The sum of the genetic information contained in the chromosome of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4403" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">mitochondrion</a>, a structure located in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2907" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cytoplasm</a> outside the nucleus of the cell. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4401" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">mitochondrial genome</a> is composed of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8921" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">mitochondrial DNA</a> (mDNA), a double-stranded circular molecule that contains a limited number of genes. During fertilization, mDNA is transmitted only by the mother. Together, the mitochondrial genome and the chromosomal genome constitute the entire <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3818" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">human genome</a>.
