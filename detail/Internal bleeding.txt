The internal bleeding may occur within tissues, organs, or in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cavities/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cavities</a> of the body including the head, chest, and abdomen. Examples of other potential sites of bleeding include the eye, lining tissues of the heart, muscles, and joints. Internal bleeding may not be evident for many hours after it begins, and symptoms occur when there is significant blood loss or if a blood clot                                                      is large enough to compress an organ and prevent it from functioning properly.
