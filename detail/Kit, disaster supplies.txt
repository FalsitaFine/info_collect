Items stored in case of 
emergency, such as a prolonged power outage, earthquake, or flood. 
You and your family can cope
best by preparing for disaster before it strikes. One way to prepare 
is by assembling a Disaster Supplies Kit. Once disaster hits, you 
won't have time to shop or search for
supplies. But if you've gathered supplies in advance, your 
family can endure an evacuation or home confinement.    
Gather the supplies that are listed. You and your family may need 
them. Place the supplies you'd most likely need for an evacuation in 
an easy-to-carry container. These supplies are listed with an 
asterisk (*).
