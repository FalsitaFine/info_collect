Muscular atrophy, post-polio (PPMA): Late muscle wasting that occurs as part of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/post-polio_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">post-polio syndrome</a> (PPS), a constellation of symptoms and signs that appear belatedly, from 20 to 40 years, after the initial <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/polio_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">polio</a> infection and at least 10 years after what was once thought to be the "recovery" from polio. The typical features of PPS include unaccustomed <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">weakness</a>, muscle <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a> (and sometimes "central" <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">fatigue</a>), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pain</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breathing</a> and/or swallowing difficulties, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep disorders</a>, muscle twitching (fasciculations) and gastrointestinal problems. The muscle problems in PPS can occur in previously-affected muscles or in muscles that were previously thought not to be muscles that were not affected at onset of the polio. The onset of PPS is usually gradual, over a period of years, but sometimes abrupt, with major loss of function suffered over several months or a couple of years. This process seems often to start after a physical or emotional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a>, an illness or accident.
