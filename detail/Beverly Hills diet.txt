Beverly Hills diet: The Beverly Hills diet is  a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a> plan based upon the premise that eating certain fruits leads to chemical reactions in the body that enhance weight loss. Only fruit is consumed for the first period (usually 10 days) on this diet, and then carbohydrates (on day 11) and protein (on day 19) are permitted. The Beverly Hills diet has not been recommended by medical professionals as a weight loss plan and is not considered a healthy way to lose weight.
