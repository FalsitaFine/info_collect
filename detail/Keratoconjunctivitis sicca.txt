Keratoconjunctivitis sicca: also known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dry_eye/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="SYM">dry eye syndrome</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/keratitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="DT">keratitis</a> sicca, a condition characterized by the inability of the eye to produce sufficient tears to keep it moist. It is more common in older adults and in some cases may be associated with underlying diseases such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sjogrens_syndrome/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="DT">Sjogren's syndrome</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="DT">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/systemic_lupus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="DT">lupus</a>. Vision disturbances and loss can occur in more severe cases. Treatments may include lubricant eye drops, hot compresses, or medications. Silicone plugs to block the tear ducts have also been used effectively to increase moisture in the eye in some patients. Medicated eye drops of cyclosporine (Restasis) can sometimes be helpful.
