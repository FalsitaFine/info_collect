Hypoparathyroidism: Underfunction of the parathyroid glands with deficient production of the hormone <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4771" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">parathormone</a> which leads to low blood calcium (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3855" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">hypocalcemia</a>). The parathyroid glands are located adjacent to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5778" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">thyroid gland</a>. They may be missing due to a birth defect, impaired by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2402" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">autoimmune disease</a>, or surgically removed during thyroid surgery. Treatment is with oral calcium supplements and oral vitamin D. Oral vitamin D increases the gut absorption of calcium in the diet and helps to maintain normal blood calcium levels.
