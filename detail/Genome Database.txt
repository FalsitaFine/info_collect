Genome Database: The Genome Database (GDB) is the official central repository for genomic mapping data resulting from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3818" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Human Genome</a> Initiative. It was established at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, USA in 1990. In 1999, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=16836" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Bioinformatics</a> Supercomputing Centre (BiSC) at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, assumed the management of GDB. The Human Genome Initiative is a worldwide research effort to analyze the structure of human DNA and determine the location and sequence of the estimated 100,000 human genes. In support of this project, GDB stores and curates data generated worldwide by those researchers engaged in the mapping effort of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3819" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Human Genome Project</a> (HGP).
