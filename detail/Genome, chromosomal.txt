Genome, chromosomal: All of the genetic information in
the chromosomes of an organism. For humans, that is all of the DNA contained in our normal
complement of 46 rod-like chromosomes in virtually every cell in the body. (Mature red
blood cells, for one exception, have no nucleus and therefore no chromosomes). The
chromosomal genome is synonymous with the nuclear genome. Together with the mitochondrial
genome, it constitutes the genome of the human being.
