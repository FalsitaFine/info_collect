Fear of blushing: An abnormal and persistent fear of blushing. Sufferers of this fear experience undue <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a> even though they realize their fear is irrational. Their anxiety results from worry about being the focus of attention and the subject of embarrassment. Attempts to suppress blushing often have the opposite effect. Sufferers of erythrophobia tend to avoid social gatherings and workplace projects that require them to interact with, or speak before, groups of co-workers. The fear of blushing is termed "erythrophobia," which also can refer to fear of the color red because of what it may symbolize, such as blood. The terms "redcoat" (British soldier in the American Revolution) and "red" (synonym for "communist") gave Americans valid reasons to fear red. Other terms with "red" that have a negative connotation include "redeye" (an overnight air flight), "caught red-handed" (caught with evidence of guilt) "red-herring" (a deceptive tactic), "red ink" (a financial loss) and "seeing red" (angry).
"Erythrophobia" is derived from the Greek "erythros" (red) and "phobos" (fear). "Erythros" also gives us the English words "erythema" (inflammation of the skin that causes reddening) and "erythrocyte" (a red blood cell).
