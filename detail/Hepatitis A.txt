HAV is usually transmitted from person to person by food or drink that has been contaminated with the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stool_color_changes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stool</a> of a person with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_hepatitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hepatitis</a> A. This type of transmission is called "fecal-oral." The virus is more easily spread in areas where there are poor sanitary conditions or where good personal hygiene is not observed. Casual contact, as in a school, office, or another work setting, does not spread the virus.<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Hepatitis</a> A can be transmitted by men (both adolescents and adults) who have sex with men. Hepatitis A outbreaks among men who have sex with men have been frequently reported. The virus can also be transmitted by illegal-drug users. Hepatitis A develops within 2 months of exposure to the virus. The average incubation period for the virus is 28 days (range: 15-50 days) until symptoms appear. Hepatitis A can range greatly in severity. Some persons with hepatitis A virus infection have no signs or symptoms of the disease. Older persons are more likely to have symptoms than children. In its most dire form, the disease can lead to liver failure and death. This is relatively rare.The symptoms and signs tend to appear abruptly and may include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fatigue</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loss_of_appetite/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">loss of appetite</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abdominal pain</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/jaundice_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">jaundice</a> (yellowing of the skin and eyes) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dark_urine/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">dark urine</a>. Symptoms usually last less than 2 months. A few persons are ill for as long as 6 months. Recovery is usually complete. The diagnosis of hepatitis A is confirmed by a blood test (IgM anti-HAV). When immediate protection against hepatitis A infection is needed, immunoglobulin (gamma globulin) is used. Immunoglobulin is effective only if given within two weeks of exposure, and protection only lasts for two to four months. Immunoglobulin can be used to protect household contacts of someone with acute <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_hepatitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">viral hepatitis</a>, and by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/travel_medicine/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">travelers</a> who must depart for regions with poor sanitation and high hepatitis A rates before <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">vaccines</a> can take effect. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/travel_health/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">Travelers</a> can receive immunoglobulin and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_immunizations/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hepatitis A vaccine</a> simultaneously.
