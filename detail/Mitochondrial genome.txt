Mitochondrial genome: The sum of the genetic information contained in the chromosome of the mitochondrion, a structure located in the cytoplasm outside the nucleus of the cell. The mitochondrial genome is composed of mitochondrial DNA (mDNA), a double-stranded circular molecule that contains a limited number of genes. During fertilization, mDNA is transmitted only by the mother. Together, the mitochondrial genome and the chromosomal genome constitute the entire human genome.
