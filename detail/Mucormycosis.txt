Mucormycosis: Also known as zygomycosis, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mucormycosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">mucormycosis</a> is a fungal infection (most commonly of the sinuses, brain, or lungs) by fungi found normally in the soil or in decaying vegetation. Mucormycosis can also affect the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and kidneys. Most people are exposed to these fungi on a daily basis and do not become ill, but persons with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to infection with these organisms. The infection develops after spores from the fungi are inhaled.
