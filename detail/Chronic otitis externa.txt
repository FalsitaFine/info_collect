Chronic otitis externa: Chronic inflammation of the skin lining the external ear canal leading to the ear drum. Can be caused by a number of problems including bacterial infection, a chronic skin disorder (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eczema_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">eczema</a> or seborrhea), fungus<i> (Aspergillosis)</i>, chronic irritation (hearing aids, Q-tips), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">allergy</a>, chronic drainage from middle ear disease, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> (rare), or it may simply be due to a nervous habit of frequently scratching the ear.  More than one factor may be involved. For example, a patient with eczema may subsequently develop black ear drainage. This would be suggestive of an accompanying fungus.  In diabetics or immune-suppressed individuals, chronic external otitis can become a very serious disease (malignant external otitis). Malignant external otitis is a misnomer because it is not a tumor or a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>, but rather an aggressive bacterial<i> (Pseudomonas) </i>infection of the bone that can lead to infection of the base of the skull.
