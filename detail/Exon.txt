Exon: The region of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3560">gene</a> that contains the code for producing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6554">protein</a>. Each exon codes for a specific portion of the complete protein. Exons are separated by introns, long regions of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3090">DNA</a> that have no apparent function.
Exons are also called coding DNA.
