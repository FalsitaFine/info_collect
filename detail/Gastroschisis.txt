Gastroschisis: A birth defect in which there is a separation in the abdominal wall. Through this opening protrudes part of the intestines which are not covered by peritoneum (the membrane that normally lines the inside of the abdomen). The opening in the abdominal wall in gastroschisis is never at the site of the umbilicus (the navel or belly button). Rather, the umbilicus is characteristically to the left of the gastroschisis and is separated from it by a bridge of skin.
