Antibiotic: A drug used to treat bacterial infections. Antibiotics have no effect on viral infections.  Originally, an antibiotic was a substance produced by one microorganism that selectively inhibits the growth of another. Synthetic antibiotics, usually chemically related to natural antibiotics, have since been produced that accomplish comparable tasks.
