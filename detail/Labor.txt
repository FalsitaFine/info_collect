Labor: Childbirth, the process of delivering a baby and the placenta, membranes, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11851" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">umbilical cord</a> from the uterus to the vagina to the outside world. During the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3466" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">first stage of labor</a> (which is called dilation), the cervix dilates fully to a diameter of about 10 cm (2 inches). The first stage of labor is divided into two phases: the latent phase and the active phase. In the latent phase, contractions become progressively more coordinated and the cervix dilates to 4 cm (approximately 1.5 inches). The latent phase averages about 8 hours for a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4598" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">nullipara</a> (a woman having her first baby) and 5 hours for a multipara (a woman having a subsequent baby). In the active phase, the cervix becomes fully dilated and the presenting part of the baby descends into the midpelvis. The active phase averages about 5 hours for a nullipara and 2 hours for a multipara. In the second stage (which is called expulsion), the baby moves out through the cervix and vagina to be born. Expulsion generally lasts 2 hours for a nullipara and l hour for a multipara. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5756" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">third stage of labor</a> begins with the delivery of the baby and ends when the placenta and membranes are expelled. Also known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4792" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">parturition</a> and childbirth.
