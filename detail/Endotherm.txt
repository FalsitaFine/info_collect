animal (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=40191" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">homo sapiens</a>). Another term for us warm-blooded creatures is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9614" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">homeotherm</a>.
An endotherm or homeotherm is as opposed to a poikilotherm (an organism such as a frog that is cold-blooded) and a stenotherm (a creature that can only survive only within a very narrow temperature range).  Endotherm is entirely Greek (as to origin). The Greek "endo-" means "within" + "-therm" is from the Greek "therme" meaning "heat" = the heat within.
