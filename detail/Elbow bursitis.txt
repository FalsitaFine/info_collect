Elbow bursitis: A common form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acute_and_chronic_bursitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bursitis</a> that is also known as olecranon bursitis. At the tip of the elbow (olecranon area) is the olecranon bursa, a fluid-filled sac that functions as a gliding surface to reduce friction during motion. Because of its location, the olecranon bursa is subject to trauma, ranging from simple repetitive weight-bearing while leaning to banging in a fall. Such trauma can cause elbow bursitis in the area overlying the point of the elbow. If elbow bursitis is not caused by infection, treatment includes rest and the use of ice and medications for inflammation and pain. Infectious bursitis is treated with antibiotics, aspiration, and surgery.
