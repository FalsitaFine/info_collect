Giant cell arteritis: A serious disease characterized
by inflammation of the walls of the blood vessels (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vasculitis/article.htm">vasculitis</a>). The vessels affected by
the inflammation are the arteries (hence the name "arteritis"). The age of
affected patients is usually over 50 years of age. Giant cell arteritis can lead to
blindness and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm">stroke</a>. It is detected by a biopsy of an artery. Giant cell arteritis is
treated with high dose cortisone-related medications. Also called temporal arteritis or
cranial arteritis.
