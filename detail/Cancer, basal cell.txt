Cancer, basal cell: The most common type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_cancer_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">skin cancer</a>, a disease in which the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> cells resemble the basal cells of the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin.  Basal cell carcinomas usually appear as the classic "sore that doesn't heal."  A bleeding or scabbing sore that seems to get somewhat better, then recurs and starts to bleed, may be a basal cell carcinoma.    Most basal cell carcinomas are on the face and neck where the skin is exposed to sunlight. However, a fair number show up on parts of the body such as the abdomen, leg, and scalp exposed to little or no sunlight.  Basal cell carcinomas typically are locally invasive. They tend to burrow in locally and not metastasize (spread) to distant locations.
