Asperger syndrome:  An autistic disorder most notable for the often great discrepancy between the intellectual and social abilities of those who have it. 
Asperger syndrome is a pervasive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11145">developmental disorder</a> 
that is characterized by an inability to understand how to interact socially. 
Typical features of the syndrome also may include clumsy and uncoordinated motor 
 movements, social impairment with extreme egocentricity, limited interests and unusual preoccupations, repetitive routines or rituals, speech and language peculiarities, and non-verbal communication problems. 
People with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asperger_syndrome/article.htm">Asperger syndrome</a> ("Aspies" as many call themselves) generally have few facial expressions apart from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33843">anger</a> or misery. Most have excellent rote <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11642">memory</a> and musical ability, and become intensely interested in one or two subjects (sometimes to the exclusion of other topics). They may talk at length about a favorite subject or repeat a word or phrase many times. People with Asperger syndrome tend to be "in their own world" and preoccupied with their own agenda. 
The onset of Asperger syndrome commonly occurs after the 
age of 3. Some individuals who exhibit features of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_and_communication/article.htm">autism</a> (a developmental brain 
 disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and 
communication skills) but who have well-developed language skills may 
be diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. 
There is no specific course of treatment or cure for Asperger 
syndrome. Treatment, which is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=20424">symptomatic</a> and rehabilitational, may 
include both psychosocial and psychopharmacological interventions 
such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psychotherapy/article.htm">psychotherapy</a>, parent education and training, behavioral 
modification, social skills training, educational interventions, 
and/or medications including psychostimulants, mood stabilizers, beta 
blockers, and  tricyclic-type <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/antidepressants/article.htm">antidepressants</a>.
Children with Asperger syndrome have a better outlook than those 
with other forms of pervasive developmental disorders and are much 
more likely to grow up to be independently functioning adults. 
Nonetheless, in most cases, these individuals will continue to 
demonstrate, to some extent, subtle disturbances in social 
interactions. There is also an increased risk for development of 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5110"> psychosis</a> (a mental 
disorder) and/or mood problems such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/depression/article.htm">depression</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm">anxiety</a> in the later years.
The syndrome is named for Hans Asperger who in 1944 published a paper that described a pattern of behavior in several young boys who had normal intelligence and language development but who had autistic-like behavior. Hans Asperger (1906-1980) was a pioneering pediatrician in Austria. He headed the play-pedagogic station at the university children's clinic in Vienna in 1932 and became director of the children's clinic in 1946. His special interest was in "psychically <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=22433">abnormal</a>" children.
