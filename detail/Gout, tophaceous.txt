Gout, tophaceous: A form of chronic gout whereby 
nodular
masses of uric acid crystals (tophi) are deposited in different soft 
tissue areas of the
body. Even though tophi are most commonly found as hard nodules 
around the fingers, at the
tips of the elbows, and around the big toe, tophi nodules can appear 
anywhere in the body.
They have been reported in unexpected areas such as in the ears, 
vocal cords, or against the spinal cord.
