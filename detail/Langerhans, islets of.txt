Langerhans, islets of: Best known as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insulin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">insulin</a>-producing tissue, the
islets
of Langerhans do more than that. They are groups of specialized cells in
the
pancreas that make and secrete hormones. Named after the German
pathologist
Paul Langerhans (1847-1888), who discovered them in 1869, these cells sit
in
groups that Langerhans likened to little islands in the pancreas. There
are
five types of cells in an islet: alpha cells that make <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glucagon/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">glucagon</a>, which
raises
the level of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glucose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">glucose</a> (sugar) in the blood; beta cells that make insulin;
delta
cells that make somatostatin which inhibits the release of numerous other
hormones in the body; and PP cells and D1 cells, about which little is
known.
Degeneration of the insulin-producing beta cells is the main cause of type
