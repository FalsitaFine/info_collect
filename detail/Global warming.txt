Global warming: The sustained increase in the average temperature of the earth's atmosphere. Human activity contributes to this change through the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Over time, this increase may be sufficient to cause climatic change, including raising sea levels, altering precipitation patterns and changing water supplies and crop yields. Global warming could also affect human health, harm wildlife and damage fragile ecosystems.
