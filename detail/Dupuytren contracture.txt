Dupuytren contracture:  
A localized formation of scar tissue in the palm of the hand within a tissue 
(fascia) beneath the skin of the palm that normally covers the tendons that pull 
the fingers into a grip. As <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dupuytren_contracture/article.htm">Dupuytren's contracture</a> progresses, more of the 
fascia becomes thickened and shortened. Dimpling and puckering of the skin over 
the area eventually occurs. The precise cause of of Dupuytren's contracture is 
not known. Causes include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm">diabetes mellitus</a>, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizure/article.htm">seizure disorders</a> (epilepsy), and 
alcoholism. It also can be inherited. Most patients with Dupuytren's contracture 
require only stretching exercises with heat application. When the palm is 
persistently sore with grasping, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm">ultrasound</a> treatments can be helpful. Sometimes 
local inflammation can be relieved with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cortisone_injection/article.htm">cortisone injection</a>. For patients with 
significant fixed flexed posture (contracture) of the fingers from Dupuytren's 
contracture, injections of collagenase or surgical procedures can removed the 
scarred tissue to free the fingers.
