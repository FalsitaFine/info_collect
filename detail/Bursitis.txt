<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acute_and_chronic_bursitis/article.htm">Bursitis</a>: Bursitis is inflammation of a bursa. A 
bursa is a tiny fluid-filled sac that functions as a gliding surface 
to reduce friction between tissues of the body. The major bursae are 
located adjacent to the tendons near the large joints, such as the 
shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees.
