Connexon: A special type of protein composed of an assembly of six subunits that are called connexins.  A connexon of one cell is joined to that of an adjacent cell to form an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25717" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">intercellular</a> channel consisting of 12 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=16318" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">connexin</a> subunits. Clusters of intercellular channels are known as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32536" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">gap junction</a> because of the minute <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=24384" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">extracellular</a> "gap" that separates the apposed plasma membranes. Each intercellular channel provides an axial channel that interconnects the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2907" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cytoplasm</a> of the apposed cell directly and permits the passage of ion and other small molecules between adjacent cells.
