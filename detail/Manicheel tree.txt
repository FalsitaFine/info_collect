Manicheel tree: A dangerous tropical tree whose sap is highly poisonous and corrosive. The sap comes out when a leaf is crushed, a branch broken, or the fruit of the tree eaten. The manicheel is hazardous to stand under for shelter from the heat of the tropical sun or, worse, the rain.
The leaves of the manicheel are small, round and green but bisected by a yellow vein. The fruit of the manicheel looks like a small green apple.
In the event of contact with manicheel sap, one should seek immediate medical attention. The formal botanical name of the manicheel is Hippomane mancinella. In French, the tree is called a "mancenillier" and in Spanish, a "manzana" meaning apple.
