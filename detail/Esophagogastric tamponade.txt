Esophagogastric tamponade: A procedure in which a 
balloon is inflated within
the esophagus and stomach to apply pressure on bleeding 
blood vessels,
compress the vessels, and stop the bleeding. Used in the 
treatment of
bleeding veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices) and 
stomach. The
balloon used in the esophagus is shaped like a sausage 
while that in the
stomach is rounded. Esophagogastric tamponade is also 
called balloon
tamponade. The word "tamponade" is direct from the French. 
The French verb
"tamponner" means to plug up.
