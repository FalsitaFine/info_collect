Multifactorial inheritance: The type of hereditary 
pattern seen when there is more than one <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3573">genetic</a> factor involved and, 
sometimes, when there are also environmental factors participating in the causation of a condition.
Many common traits are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4452">multifactorial</a>. Skin color, for example, is multifactorially determined. So is height and so also is intelligence.
The most common diseases tend also to multifactorial. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18055">Type 2 diabetes</a>, the most common type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11148">diabetes</a>, is multifactorial. It is due to the inheritance of susceptibility <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15391">genes</a> (genes that make one susceptible to developing diabetes) plus environmental factors such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4607">obesity</a>. Obesity, in turn, clearly is multifactorial in causation.
