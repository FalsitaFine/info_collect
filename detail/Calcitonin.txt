Calcitonin: A hormone produced by the thyroid gland that lowers the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood and promotes the formation of bone. Bone is in a constant state of remodeling. Old bone is removed by cells called osteoclasts, and new bone is added by cells called osteoblasts. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/calcitonin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Calcitonin</a> inhibits bone removal by the osteoclasts and at the same time promotes bone formation by the osteoblasts. Calcitonin is given in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypercalcemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hypercalcemia</a> (high blood calcium) to lower the calcium level; in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">osteoporosis</a> to increase bone density and decrease the risk of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/broken_bone_types_of_bone_fractures/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fracture</a>; and in Paget disease to decrease bone turnover and bone pain.
