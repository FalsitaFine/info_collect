Gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma: This is a serious form of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> that originates in the area where the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/esophagus_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">esophagus</a> transitions into the stomach.  Gastroesophageal junction <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">adenocarcinoma</a> is frequently lethal. Surgical operation and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chemotherapy</a> (adjuvant treatment) are used as treatments.  People with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/barretts_esophagus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Barrett's esophagus</a> are at an increased risk for developing gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. In Barrett's esophagus, the normal cells of the area of the esophagus that enters the stomach are replaced by a different type of cell. The new cell lining is not cancerous but can predispose to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cancer</a> development.  Gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma is also referred to as esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma.
