Leaky gut or leaky gut syndrome is defined as a reduced barrier to the passage (leakage) of molecules from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4004" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">intestine</a> into the wall of the intestine and from there, possibly into the body.  There is no question that in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25870" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">pathologic</a> states molecules enter the wall of the intestine that normally are excluded.  It is problematic to determine, however, whether leakage causes the disease or the disease causes the leakage.  In most cases, the latter is believed to be the case.  Leaky gut is not recognized as a specific disease; leakage may, however, complicate underlying disease.  For example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3979" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">inflammation</a> of the intestine may allow <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15038" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">bacterial</a> toxins to enter the body where it can affect various organs.
