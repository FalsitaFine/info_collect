Immunization, DTaP: Like DPT, DTaP protects from
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diphtheria_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt"> diphtheria</a>, pertussis (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pertussis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">whooping cough</a>) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tetanus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tetanus</a>. DTaP is the same as DTP, except that
it contains only acellular pertussis vaccine which is thought to cause fewer of the minor
reactions associated with immunization and is also probably less likely to cause the more
severe reactions occasionally seen following pertussis vaccination. DTaP is currently
recommended only for the shots given at 18 months and 4-6 years of age.
