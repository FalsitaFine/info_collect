Fear of ghosts: An abnormal and persistent fear of ghosts. Sufferers of this fear experience undue <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a> even though they realize their fear is irrational. They may fear going into woods, empty houses or dark places and may react with alarm at strange or unexplained noises. No doubt Hollywood has enkindled spectrophobia with such films as <i>Poltergeist</i>, <i>The Haunting</i> and <i>The Blair Witch Project.</i>
Fear of ghosts is termed "spectrophobia," a hybrid word derived from the Latin "spectrum" (appearance, apparition) and the Greek "phobos" (fear). "Spectrum" is also used to form many other English words, including a word with the same spelling, "spectrum" (the series of color bands of light appearing after white light passes through a diffracting device such as a prism); "spectrology" (the scientific study of the spectrum); and "specter" (apparition, ghost).
