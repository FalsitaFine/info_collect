Noncoding DNA: The strand of DNA that does not carry the information necessary to make proteins. DNA normally has two strands -- the coding strand and the non-coding strand. Although these strands are exact mirror images of one another, only the coding strand contains the information for making proteins. The non-coding strand does not.  Noncoding DNA is also known as the antisense strand.
