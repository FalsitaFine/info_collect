Heart rate: The number of heartbeats per unit of time, usually per minute. The heart rate is based on the number of contractions of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=26788" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">ventricles</a> (the lower chambers of the heart). The heart rate may be too fast (tachycardia) or too slow (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2515" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">bradycardia</a>). The pulse is a bulge of an artery from waves of blood that course through the blood vessels each time the heart beats. The pulse is often taken at the wrist to estimate the heart rate.
