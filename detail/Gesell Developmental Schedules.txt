Gesell Developmental Schedules: A measure of child development devised by the American child psychologist and pediatrician Arnold Gesell (1880-1961) who founded the Clinic of Child Development at Yale in 1911 and directed it for many years. There he pioneered the use of motion-picture cameras to study the development of normal infants and young children. He filmed the children, analyzed their functioning frame-by-frame, and learned the normal stages in early human behavioral development. The Gesell Developmental Schedules are a gauge of the status of a child's motor and language development and personal-social and adaptive behaviors.
