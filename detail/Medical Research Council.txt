Medical Research Council: In the United Kingdom
(UK) and some Commonwealth countries, MRC stands for the Medical Research Council which
serves more or less as the counterpart of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9786" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH) in the
United States, at least in playing the important role of funding extramural biomedical
research. The MRCs have similarly supported brilliant biomedical research during the 20<sup>th</sup>
century.
