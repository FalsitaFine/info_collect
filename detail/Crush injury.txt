Crush injury: An injury that occurs because of pressure from a heavy object onto a body part. A crush injury may also arise from squeezing of a body part between two objects. Depending upon their severity, crush injuries can be complicated by bleeding, bruising, broken bones, open wounds, poor circulation, or breakdown of muscle (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rhabdomyolysis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rhabdomyolysis</a>).
