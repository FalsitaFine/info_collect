Adapter protein: A protein acts as a connecting molecule. An adapter protein is critical to intermolecular interactions and plays a role in the regulation of signal transduction initiated by engagement of surface receptors on all cell types. Some adapter proteins are expressed in all tissues, while the expression of other adapter proteins is restricted to specific tissues.
