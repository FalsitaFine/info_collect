Effusion: Too much fluid, an outpouring of fluid. For example, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pleural_effusion_fluid_in_the_chest_or_on_lung/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pleural effusion</a> is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space between the lungs and the chest wall, while a knee effusion is an abnormal amount of fluid in the knee joint. A hemorrhagic effusion contains blood in the fluid.
