<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/angina_symptoms/article.htm">Angina</a>, variant: Chest pain due to coronary 
artery spasm, a sudden
constriction of a coronary artery (one of the vessels that 
supply the heart
muscle with blood rich in oxygen) depriving the heart 
muscle (myocardium) of
blood and oxygen. This is also called Prinzmetal angina. 
Coronary artery
spasm can be triggered by emotional stress, medicines, 
street drugs
(cocaine) or exposure to cold. Treatments include beta-
blocker medications
and, classically, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nitroglycerin/article.htm">nitroglycerin</a> to permit the coronary 
arteries to open up
(dilate).
