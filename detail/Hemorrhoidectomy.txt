Hemorrhoidectomy: Surgical removal of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemorrhoids_piles/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hemorrhoids</a> (enlarged and dilated veins in and around the anus). Hemorrhoidectomy is usually reserved for severe hemorrhoids if more conservative treatment measures fail to alleviate the symptoms (burning, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">itching</a>, swelling, protrusion, bleeding, and pain).  Hemorrhoidectomy may be done with a standard scalpel or with an ultrasonic scalpel to cut away hemorrhoids (a method that does not require sutures). Another sutureless method involves staples. Tissue from further in the anus is used to close the wound with surgical staples after the hemorrhoids are removed.
