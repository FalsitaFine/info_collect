Bone scan: A nuclear medicine technique for creating images of bones on a computer screen or <br/> on film. A small amount of radioactive material <br/> is injected into a vein and travels through the <br/> bloodstream. It collects in the bones, especially in abnormal areas of the bones, and is detected by an instrument called a scanner. Bone scans are used for the detection and monitoring of disorders that affect the bones, including Paget disease, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>, infections, and fractures. Bone scanning is also helpful in evaluating and measuring the activity of certain joint diseases.
