Cyclops: A common freshwater crustacean. Some species of Cyclops serve as hosts for parasites such as the guinea worm, the cause of dracunculiasis (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/guinea_worm_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">guinea worm disease</a>).

The Cyclops were one-eyed giants of Greek mythology, a mythical race of lawless giant shepherds who lived in Sicily. They had a single large round eye in the center of the forehead. 
The word "cyclops" itself comes from the Greek "kyklos" (circle) + "ops" (eye). Cyclopia is a congenital malformation (birth defect) in which there is only one eye located just above the customary location of the nose.
