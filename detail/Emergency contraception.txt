Emergency contraception may use drugs related to the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. These "morning-after pill" are similar to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">birth control</a> pills but generally contain higher hormone doses.

Emergency contraception is also known as emergency birth control; emergency postcoital contraception; and postcoital contraception.
