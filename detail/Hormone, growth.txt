Hormone, growth: A hormone made in the pituitary gland that stimulates the release of another hormone called somatomedin by the liver, thereby causing growth. Growth hormone is synonymous with somatotropin and somatropin. More specifically (and technically), growth hormone is produced by the anterior pituitary, the front section of the gland, and is a polypeptide consisting of 191 amino acids. It induces increased protein synthesis, increased mobilization of free fatty acids, and decreased <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glucose/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">glucose</a> utilization.    Growth hormone is given to children with pituitary dwarfism (short stature due to underfunction of the anterior pituitary) to help them grow.
