ATM: Symbol for the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. The protein made by the ATM gene functions to control the rate at which cells grow. The ATM protein does this by sending signals and modifying proteins in the cell, which then alters the function of the proteins. This protein also interacts with other proteins (for example BRCA1) to respond when DNA is damaged as a result of exposure to some type of radiation. If the strands of DNA are broken, the ATM protein coordinates DNA repair by activating other proteins. This function helps to maintain the stability of the cell's genome. Because of its central role in cell division and DNA repair, the ATM protein is important to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> biology.
