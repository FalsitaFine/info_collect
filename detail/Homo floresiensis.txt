Homo floresiensis: A human-like species who lived until 18,000 years ago in the company of giant Komodo lizards and now-extinct pygmy elephants on the isolated island of Flores in Indonesia. Homo floresiensis was only one meter (3 feet) tall and had a brain one-third the size of that of modern humans. Nicknamed hobbits, these people lived on this isolated island long after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=40191" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Homo sapiens</a> had migrated through the South Pacific region. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=40192" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Homo erectus</a>, our closest relative, lived on the nearby island of Java as long as 1.6 million years ago, suggesting that the Flores hominins were their descendants.
