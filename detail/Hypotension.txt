Hypotension: Any blood pressure that is below the 
normal expected for an individual in a given environment.  
Hypotension is the opposite of hypertension (abnormally high 
blood pressure). 
Hypotension is a relative term because the blood pressure normally 
varies greatly with activity, age, medications, and underlying 
medical conditions.
