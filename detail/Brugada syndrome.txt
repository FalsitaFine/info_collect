Brugada syndrome is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a> in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that one affected parent can pass the condition along to offspring. Other cases can occur due to new mutations in the genes and are not inherited from a parent. The genetic problem in Brugada syndrome can occur in several different genes. It is most common in people of Asian descent and is more common in men than in women. The signs and symptoms of Brugada syndrome, including sudden death, can occur from early infancy to late adulthood.
