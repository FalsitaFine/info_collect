Cystitis: Inflammation of the bladder. Cystitis can 
be
due for example to infection from bacteria that ascend the urethra 
(the canal from the
outside) to the bladder.
Symptoms include a frequent need to urinate, often accompanied by a 
burning sensation. As cystitis progresses, blood may be observed in 
the urine and the patient may suffer cramps after urination. In young 
children, attempts to avoid the pain of cystitis can be a cause for 
daytime wetting (enuresis). Treatment includes avoiding irritants, 
such as perfumed soaps, near the urethral opening; increased fluid 
intake; and antibiotics. Untreated cystitis can lead to scarring and 
the formation of stones when urine is retained for long periods of 
time to avoid painful urination.
