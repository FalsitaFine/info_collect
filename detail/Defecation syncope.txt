Defecation syncope:  The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7662">temporary loss of consciousness</a> (syncope) upon defecating (having a bowel movement). Syncope is the temporary loss of consciousness or, in plain English, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fainting/article.htm">fainting</a>. The situations that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=30700">trigger</a> this reaction are diverse and include having blood drawn, straining while urinating (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9308">micturition syncope</a>) or defecating, coughing or swallowing. The reaction also can be due to the emotional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm">stress</a> of fear or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4723">pain</a>.

Under these conditions, people often become pale and feel nauseated, sweaty, and  weak just before they lose consciousness. 

<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7704"> Situational syncope</a> is caused by a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5266">reflex</a> of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18375">involuntary</a> nervous system called the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7713">vasovagal reaction</a>. The vasovagal reaction leads the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3668">heart</a> to slow down (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2515">bradycardia</a>) and, at the same time, it leads the nerves to the blood vessels in the legs to permit those vessels 
to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3001">dilate</a> (widen). The result is that the heart puts out less blood, the blood pressure drops, and what blood is circulating tends to go into the legs rather than to the head. The brain is then deprived of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10690">oxygen</a>, and the fainting episode occurs.

The vasovagal reaction is also called a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7715">vasovagal attack</a>. And situational syncope is also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7706">vasovagal syncope</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7709">vasodepressor syncope</a>, and Gower <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5613">syndrome</a> after Sir William Richard Gower (1845-1915), a famous English <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4553">neurologist</a> 
whose name is also associated with a sign, a solution, another syndrome, and a tract in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2667">central nervous system</a>.
