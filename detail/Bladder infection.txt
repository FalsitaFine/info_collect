Some people are at more risk for bladder and other <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm">urinary tract infections (UTIs)</a> than others. Women are at greater risk than men. One woman in five develops a UTI during her lifetime. Not everyone with a UTI has symptoms. Common symptoms include a frequent urge to urinate and a painful, burning when urinating. Underlying conditions that impair the normal urinary flow can lead to more complicated UTIs.
