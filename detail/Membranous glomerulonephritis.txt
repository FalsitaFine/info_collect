The main sign of the disease is marked proteinuria. The majority of cases are primary, meaning the cause is not known. The remaining cases are secondary to conditions such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>, infection, and drug side effects.
