Human embryonic stem cell: Also known as a human pluripotent stem cell, one of the "cells that are self-replicating, are derived from human embryos or human fetal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5800">tissue</a>, and are known to develop into cells and tissues of the three primary germ layers. Although human pluripotent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stem_cells/article.htm">stem cells</a> may be derived from embryos or fetal tissue, such stem cells are not themselves embryos." (From the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9786">National Institutes of Health</a> Guidelines for Research Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.)
"Self-replicating" means the cell can divide and to form cells indistinguishable from it. The "three primary germ layers" -- called the ectoderm, mesoderm, and 
endoderm -- are the primary layers of cells in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3225">embryo</a> from which all tissues and organs develop.
