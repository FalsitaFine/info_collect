Cesarian section, vaginal birth after: It was once the rule that, after a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/c-section_cesarean_birth/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">C-section</a>, the next delivery also had to be by C-section. Now, vaginal delivery after Cesarian section (VBAC) is sometimes feasible. Age is one the factors that need to be considered, since women over 30 who try a vaginal delivery after a C-section are about three times more likely to have a uterine rupture than younger women.
