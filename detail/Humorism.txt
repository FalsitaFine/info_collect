Humorism: In medicine, humor refers to a fluid 
(or semifluid) substance. Thus, the aqueous humor is the fluid normally present in the front and rear chambers of the eye. The humors were part of an ancient theory that held that health came from balance between the bodily liquids. These liquids were
termed humors. Disease arose when imbalance occurred between the humors.
