Chimera: In medicine, a person composed of two genetically distinct types of cells. Human chimeras were first discovered with the advent of blood typing when it was found that some people had more than one blood type. Most of them proved to be "blood chimeras" -- non-identical twins who shared a blood supply in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5918">uterus</a>. Those who were not twins are thought to have blood cells from a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11428">twin</a> that died early in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3589">gestation</a>. Twin embryos often share a blood supply in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4918">placenta</a>, allowing blood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stem_cells/article.htm">stem cells</a> to pass from one and settle in the bone marrow of the other. About 8% of non-identical twin pairs are chimeras. 
Many more people are microchimeras and carry smaller numbers of foreign blood cells that may have passed from mother across the placenta, or persist from a blood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5836">transfusion</a>. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7298">In vitro fertilization</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7222">IVF</a>) is also contributing to the number of human chimeras.  To improve success rates, two or more embryos are placed in the uterus so women who have IVF have more twin pregnancies than usual. More twins mean more chimeras.
In Greek mythology, the Chimera was an awesome
fire-breathing monster with the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent.  The Chimera was killed by the hero Bellerophon mounted, in most versions of the tale, on Pegasus, the winged horse.
