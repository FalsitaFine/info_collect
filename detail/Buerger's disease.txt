Buerger's disease: a rare, inflammatory disease of blood vessels characterized by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_clots/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blood clot</a> (thrombus) formation. The disease usually affects small- and medium-sized arteries of the arms or legs, leading to the eventual occlusion of the arteries due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_clot_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">blood clot</a> formation. The blockages caused by the blood clots disrupt the flow of oxygen to the extremities and lead to damage to the skin and even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gangrene/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gangrene</a> of the tissues. Symptoms can include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/claudication/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">claudication</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_surprising_reasons_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">pain</a> in the extremities that occurs with activity), painful sores on the skin, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/raynauds_phenomenon/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Raynaud's phenomenon</a> (fingers that turn pale when in a cold environment). Buerger's disease is strongly associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">cigarette smoking</a> and typically affects men below the age of 40, although women may also develop the condition. Complete cessation of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_effects_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">tobacco</a> use is critical for people with Buerger's disease to stop the tissue damage. Buerger's disease also is referred to as thromboangiitis obliterans.
