<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/child_abuse_facts/article.htm">Child abuse</a>, sexual: Child abuse comprises four basic types of mistreatment:  child neglect, physical abuse of a child, emotional abuse of a child, and sexual abuse of a child.

Sexual abuse is the least frequently reported form of child abuse (6% of all cases). Experts believe that sexual abuse may be the most underreported type of child maltreatment because of the secrecy, the "conspiracy of silence" that so often surrounds these cases.
 
Sexual abuse includes fondling a child's genitals, intercourse, incest, rape, sodomy, exhibitionism, and commercial exploitation through prostitution or the production of pornographic materials.
