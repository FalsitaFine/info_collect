Gustatory sweating: Sweating on the forehead, face, scalp, 
and neck occurring soon after ingesting food. Some gustatory sweating 
is normal after eating hot, spicy foods. Otherwise, gustatory 
sweating is most commonly a result of damage to a nerve that goes to 
the parotid gland, the large salivary gland in the cheek. In this 
setting, referred to as Frey syndrome, the sweating is usually on one 
side of the head. Gustatory sweating is also a rare complication of 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm"> diabetes mellitus</a>. In this case sweating may occur on both sides of 
the head, with mild or substantial severity. This distressing 
problem can be difficult to treat. Treatments used include oxybutynin 
chloride, propantheline bromide, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clonidine/article.htm">clonidine</a> (brand name: 
Catapres). Recently, some success has been reported using topical 
applications of glycopyrrolate: the lotion was applied to the skin of 
the forehead and face, sparing the eyes and mouth. See also Frey 
syndrome, diabetes.
