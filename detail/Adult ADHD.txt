Adult ADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_in_children/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">ADHD</a>) as found in the adult population. ADHD is a well-known childhood disorder that is characterized by varying degrees of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention that lead to difficulty in academic, emotional, and social functioning. Children who are diagnosed with ADHD may continue to exhibit symptoms that persist into adulthood. In the 1970s, the condition began to be diagnosed in adults who never received the diagnosis as children but displayed many of the characteristic symptoms. While up to 5% of school-aged children are believed to have ADHD, its prevalence in the adult population is difficult to estimate, but is likely to be in the range of 1%-5% of the population. Symptoms of ADHD in adults can include difficulty following directions, problems information, difficulty with concentration, and trouble with organizing tasks or completing work within time limits. Treatment, as in the pediatric population, can involve both behavioral therapies and medications.
