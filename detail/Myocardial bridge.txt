Myocardial bridge: Literally a bridging of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9658" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">heart muscle</a> over one of the major arteries to the heart (usually the left anterior descending artery). The heart has formed in this abnormal design from birth, whereby the artery is actually 'tunneled' through a part of the heart muscle.
