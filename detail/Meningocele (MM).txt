central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). The term spina bifida refers
specifically to the bony defect in the vertebral column through which the meningeal
membrane and cord may protrude (spina bifida cystica) or may not protrude so that the
defect remains hidden, covered by skin (spina bifida occulta). However, through usage the
