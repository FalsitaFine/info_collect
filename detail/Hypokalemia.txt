Hypokalemia: Low blood potassium.  
Potassium is the major positive ion (cation) found inside of 
cells. The chemical notation for potassium is K<sup>+</sup>. 
The proper level of potassium is essential for normal cell 
function. An abnormal decrease (or increase) of potassium can 
profoundly affect the nervous system and heart, and when extreme, can 
be fatal. 
The normal blood potassium level is 3.5 - 5.0 
milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 3.5 - 5.0 
millimoles/liter (mmol/L). See also: Potassium balance.
