Named reporting: In public health, named reporting is the reporting of
infected persons by name to public health departments. This is standard practice for the
surveillance of many infectious diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tuberculosis_tb_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tuberculosis</a> that pose a public health threat. The opposite of named reporting is anonymous testing in
which the individual remains nameless.
