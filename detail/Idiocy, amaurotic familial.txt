Idiocy, amaurotic familial: An 
outdated term for Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) which is 
concisely defined by OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in 
Man) as "an autosomal recessive, progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder, which in the classic infantile 
form, is usually fatal by age 2 or 3 years, results from 
deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A. " "Autosomal" 
points to the gene for TSD residing on a nonsex (autosomal) 
chromosome (namely, chromosome15q23-q24). "Recessive" 
indicates a person with 2 copies of the gene has TSD 
whereas someone with 1 copy is a carrier in normal health. 
TSD worsens, with time, as the central nervous system 
progressively deteriorates.
