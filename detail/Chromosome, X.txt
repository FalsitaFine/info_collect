Chromosome, X: The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=20692" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">sex chromosome</a> found twice in normal females and once, along with a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6049" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Y chromosome</a>, in normal males. The complete <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2724" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">chromosome complement</a> (consisting of 46 chromosomes, including the 2 sex chromosomes) is thus conventionally written as 46,XX for chromosomally normal females and 46,XY for chromosomally normal males. The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6030" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">X chromosome</a> not only determines gender but also carries the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3574" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">genetic code</a> for many essential functions in both males and females.
