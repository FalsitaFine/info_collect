Menopause, chemical: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm">Menopause</a> induced by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm">chemotherapy</a> or other 
chemicals or medications. Chemical menopause is a type of "induced menopause." 
Induced menopause is distinct from natural menopause which occurs when the 
ovaries naturally decrease their production of the sex hormones estrogen and 
progesterone. Induced menopause, due to the abrupt reduction of ovarian 
hormones, often causes the sudden onset of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hot_flashes/article.htm">hot flashes</a> and other 
menopause-related symptoms such as dryness of the vaginal lining and a decline 
in sex drive. When the levels of hormones normally produced by the ovaries 
suddenly drop, changes associated with the menopause promptly take place: hot 
flashes (a sudden warm feeling with flushing), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/night_sweats/article.htm">night sweats</a>, mood swings, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_dryness/symptoms.htm"> vaginal dryness</a>, fluctuations in sexual desire (libido), forgetfulness, trouble 
sleeping and fatigue, probably from loss of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm">sleep</a>.
