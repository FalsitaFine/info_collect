Fallopian tube: One of the two Fallopian tubes that transport the egg from the ovary to the uterus (the womb). In the diagram, the Fallopian tubes are not labeled but are well shown running between the uterus and ovaries.

The 
Fallopian tubes have small hair-like projections called cilia on the 
cells of the lining. These tubal cilia are essential to the movement of the egg through 
the tube into the uterus. If the tubal cilia are damaged by 
infection, the egg may not get 'pushed along' normally but may stay 
in the tube.
Infection can also cause partial or complete blockage of the tube 
with scar tissue, physically preventing the egg from getting to the 
uterus.  
Any process (such as infection, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endometriosis/article.htm">endometriosis</a>, tumors, or scar 
tissue in the pelvis (pelvic adhesions) that cause twisting or 
chinking of the tube) that damages the Fallopian tube or narrows its 
diameter increases the chance of an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ectopic_pregnancy/article.htm">ectopic pregnancy</a>: a pregnancy 
developing in the Fallopian tube or another abnormal location outside 
the uterus.
These tubes bear the name of Gabriele Falloppio (also spelled 
Falloppia), a 16th-century (c. 1523-62) Italian physician and surgeon 
who was expert in anatomy, physiology and pharmacology. He was an
early expert on syphilis and one of the great surgeons of 
the age. Of the various works by Falloppio only the "Observationes 
anatomicae", a work of great originality, was published during his 
lifetime. In it he made a number of contributions to the knowledge of 
centers of ossification, to the detailed account of muscles, and to 
the understanding of the vascular system and the kidneys. His 
description of the uterine tubes was sufficiently accurate that they 
bear his name. With Vesalius and Eustachi, Fallopio is often seen as 
one of the three heroes of anatomy.
