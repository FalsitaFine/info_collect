Cutaneous papilloma:  A small tag of skin that may have a stalk (a  peduncle).  Cutaneous papillomas may appear on the skin almost anywhere although the favorite locales are the eyelids, neck, armpits (axillae), upper chest, and groin.
 Invariably benign, this tiny tumor of the skin usually causes no symptoms unless repeatedly irritated as, for example, by the collar. 
Treatment may be done by freezing with liquid nitrogen or by cutting off with a scalpel or scissors if the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/skin_tag/article.htm">skin tag</a> is irritating or cosmetically unwanted.
 Medically, a cutaneous papilloma is also called an acrochordon. But it is far better known as a skin tag.
