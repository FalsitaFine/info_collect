Nuclei, basal: A region located at the base of the brain composed of 4 clusters of neurons, or nerve cells. This area of the brain is responsible for body movement and coordination. The groups of neurons most prominently and consistently affected in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3820" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Huntington disease</a> -- the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11614" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">pallidum</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11702" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">striatum</a> -- are located in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10033" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">basal nuclei</a>.
(The pallidum is composed of structures called the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9026" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">globus pallidus</a> and the ventral pallidum while the striatum consists of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10034" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">caudate nucleus</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11935" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">putamen</a>, and ventral striatum.) The basal nuclei are also called the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10030" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">basal ganglia</a>. The term "basal" refers to the location of these collections of neurons (nuclei or ganglia) deep within the brain, seemingly at its very base.
