Group therapy: 1) A type of psychiatric care in 
which several patients meet with one or more therapists at 
the same time. The patients form a support group for each other 
as well as receiving expert care and advice. The group 
therapy model is particularly appropriate for psychiatric 
illnesses that are support-intensive, such as anxiety 
disorders, but is not well suited for treatment of some 
other psychiatric disorders. 2) A type of psychoanalysis in 
which patients analyze each other with the assistance of 
one or more psychotherapists, as in an "encounter group."
