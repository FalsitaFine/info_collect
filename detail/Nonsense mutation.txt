Nonsense mutation: A mutation (a change) in a base in the DNA that prematurely stops the translation (reading) of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4357" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">messenger RNA</a> (mRNA) resulting in a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7766" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">polypeptide</a> chain that ends prematurely and a protein product that is truncated (abbreviated) and incomplete and usually nonfunctional. 
The nonsense mutation converts a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2771" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">codon</a> (a triplet of bases) that encodes an amino acid into a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15848" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">stop codon</a>, one that specifies the termination of translation. There are three nonsense codons (UAG, UAA, and UGA) in mRNA. One of them comes normally at the end of each polypeptide. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15851" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">nonsense codon</a> is a stop codon which is out of place.

Catching such a defective messenger RNA (mRNA) before a truncated and potentially harmful protein is synthesized is the job of what is called the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway.
