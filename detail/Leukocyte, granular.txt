Leukocyte, granular:  A type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6017">white blood cell</a> filled 
with microscopic granules (tiny sacs) containing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15392">enzymes</a> that digest microorganisms.
Granular leukocytes -- they are better known as granulocytes -- are part of the innate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3907">immune system</a> and have somewhat non specific, broad-based activity. They do not respond exclusively to specific antigens, as do B-cells and T-cells. 
Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils are all types of 
granulocytes. They are named by the staining features of their granules in the 
laboratory:<ul>
<li>Neutrophils have "neutral" subtle granules; 
  <li>Eosinophils have prominent granules that stain 
  readily with the acid dye eosin; and 
  
<li>Basophils have prominent granules that stain readily basic (non acidic) dyes.</li></li></li></ul>
This classification dates back to a time when certain 
structures could be identified in cells by histochemistry, but the functions of 
these intracellular structures were still not yet fathomed. However, the classification of granulocytes into neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils is still widely used (and quite useful).
