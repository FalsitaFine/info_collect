Hemolytic uremic syndrome: A condition characterized by the breakup of red blood cells (hemolysis) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">kidney failure</a>. There is clumping of platelets (the blood cells responsible for clotting) within the kidney's small blood vessels with resultant ischemia (reduced blood flow) leading to the kidney failure.  The partial blockage of the blood vessels also leads to the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis). Platelets are also decreased which can cause bleeding problems.
