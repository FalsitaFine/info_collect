Egg donor: A woman who provides her own eggs for another woman or couple to 
use in creating a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm">pregnancy</a> through in vitro fertilization. Egg donors may be 
paid for their services, and both known and anonymous egg donors may be used in 
the IVF process. For a woman to serve as an egg donor, she must undergo health 
screening tests and take medications to stimulate the production of eggs by her 
ovaries. She must also undergo a minor surgical procedure known as egg retrieval 
in order to harvest the eggs from her ovaries.
