Apraxia of speech: A severe speech disorder 
characterized by inability to speak, or a severe struggle 
to speak clearly. Apraxia of speech occurs when the oral-
motor muscles do not or cannot obey commands from the 
brain, or when the brain cannot reliably send those 
commands. Children with apraxia can be helped significantly 
with intensive speech therapy. See also dyspraxia of 
speech.
