DNA technology, recombinant: A series of procedures
used to join together (recombine) DNA segments. A recombinant DNA molecule is constructed
(recombined) from segments from 2 or more different DNA molecules. Under certain
conditions, a recombinant DNA molecule can enter a cell and replicate there, autonomously
(on its own) or after it has become integrated into a chromosome.
