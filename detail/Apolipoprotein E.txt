Apolipoprotein E: A type of lipoprotein (a protein connected to a fat).  Apolipoprotein E is abbreviated ApoE and the gene that encodes it is known as APOE. APOE is located on chromosome 19 in band 19q13.2.  Lipoproteins are responsible for carrying <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cholesterol</a> and other fats through the bloodstream as little packages and are essential for the normal breakdown of these molecules. In particular, apolipoprotein E is a major component of specific lipoproteins called very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). A major function of VLDLs is to remove excess cholesterol from the blood and carry it to the liver for processing. Maintaining normal levels of cholesterol is essential for the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">prevention</a> of cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and strokes.
There are three isoforms (slightly different forms) of the ApoE lipoprotein. These three isoforms are known as ApoE2, E3 and E4. They are encoded by slightly different versions, or alleles, of the APOE gene. These three alleles are called APOE e2, e3, and e4 (e stands for epsilon). The most common allele is APOE e3, which is present in more than half of the population.
