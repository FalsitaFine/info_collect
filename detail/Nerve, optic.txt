Nerve, optic:   The optic nerve connects the eye to the 
brain. The optic nerve carries the impulses formed by the retina. The 
retina is the nerve layer that lines the back of the eye that senses 
light and creates impulses. These impulses are dispatched through the 
optic nerve to the brain, which interprets them as images. Using an 
ophthalmoscope, the head of the optic nerve can be easily seen. It 
can be viewed as the only visible part of the brain (or extension of 
it).
The optic nerve is the second cranial nerve. The cranial nerve 
emerge from or enter the skull (the cranium), as opposed to the 
spinal nerves which emerge from the vertebral column. There are 
twelve cranial nerves.
