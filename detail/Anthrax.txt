<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anthrax/article.htm">Anthrax</a>: A serious bacterial infection caused by Bacillus anthracis that occurs primarily in animals. Cattle, sheep, horses, mules, and some
wild animals are highly susceptible. Humans and swine are generally quite resistant to anthrax. Humans become infected when the spores of B. anthracis enter the body by contact with animals infected with B. anthracis or from contact with contaminated animal products, insect bites, ingestion, or inhalation. Aerosolized ("weaponized") spores of B. anthracis can potentially be used
(misused) for biological warfare and bioterrorism. Cutaneous anthrax is the most common form of the disease and is characterized by the development of a localized skin lesion with a central eschar surrounded by marked edema (swelling). Inhalation anthrax (woolsorters' disease) typically involves hemorrhagic mediastinitis (bleeding into the mid-chest), rapidly progressive systemic (bodywide) infection, and carries a very high mortality rate. Gastrointestinal anthrax is much rarer but is also associated with a high mortality rate.


Anthrax can, as mentioned, take different forms. One is the pulmonary (lung) form of the disease.  It is contracted by inhaling a large dose of the anthrax spores, typically in an enclosed space protected from direct sunlight. (The spores are quickly killed by sunlight.) If pulmonary anthrax is untreated, it is usually fatal. An intestinal form of anthrax is caused by eating meat contaminated with anthrax. 

But most human anthrax comes from skin contact with animal products contaminated by anthrax. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2885">Cutaneous</a> (skin) anthrax was once well known among people who handled infected animals (farmers, woolsorters, tanners, brushmakers and carpetmakers in the days when the brushes and carpets were animal products). 

The hallmark of skin anthrax is a carbuncle, a cluster of boils, that ulcerates. Typically, the carbuncle has a hard black center surrounded by bright red <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3979">inflammation</a>. This dramatic appearance accounts for its name, "anthrax", the Greek word for "coal", a burning coal. 

The cutaneous form of anthrax is treated with antibiotics such as penicillin, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tetracycline/article.htm">tetracycline</a>,
