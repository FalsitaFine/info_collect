Arrayed library: In genetics, an arrayed library
consists of (in technical terms) individual primary recombinant clones which are hosted in
phage, cosmid, YAC, or another vector that have been placed in two- dimensional arrays in
microtiter dishes (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">plastic</a> dishes with an orderly array of tiny wells). Each primary clone
can be identified by the identity of the plate and the clone location (row and column) on
that plate. Arrayed libraries of clones are used for many purposes, including screening
for a specific gene or genomic region. The information gathered on individual clones from
genetic linkage and physical map studies is then entered into a database and used to
construct physical and genetic linkage maps
