Migraine: Usually, periodic attacks of headaches on 
one or both sides of the head. These may be accompanied by nausea, 
vomiting, increased sensitivity of the eyes to light (photophobia), 
increased sensitivity to sound (phonophobia), dizziness, blurred 
vision, cognitive disturbances, and other symptoms. Some migraines do 
not include headache, and migraines may or may not be preceded by an 
aura.
