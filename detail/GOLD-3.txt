GOLD-3: One of the stages of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). GOLD-3 is stage III in the GOLD classification of COPD and indicates "severe COPD." This stage is characterized by severe airflow limitation or the presence of respiratory failure or clinical signs of right <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart failure</a> (because the right side of the heart can no longer pump blood effectively through the lungs and the blood backs up and congests the liver, intestinal tract and limbs.) At this severe stage in COPD, the quality of life is appreciably impaired and exacerbations ( turns for the worse) may be life-threatening.
