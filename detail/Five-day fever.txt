Five-day <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm">fever</a>:   Also called trench <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm">fever</a>, this is 
a disease borne by body lice that was first recognized in the 
trenches of World War I, when it is estimated to have affected more 
than a million people in Russia and on the fronts in Europe. Trench 
fever was again a major problem in 
the military in World War II and is seen endemically in Mexico, 
Africa, E. Europe, and elsewhere. 
Urban trench fever occurs among the homeless people and people 
with alcoholism today. Outbreaks have been documented, for example, 
in Seattle, Baltimore (among injection-drug users), Marseilles 
(France) and Burundi.  
The cause of trench fever is Bartonella quintana (also called 
Rochalimaea quintana), an unusual rickettsial organism that 
multiplies in the gut of the body louse. Transmission of the 
rickettsia to people can occur by rubbing infected louse feces into 
abraded (scuffed) skin or into the conjunctivae (whites of the eyes).
