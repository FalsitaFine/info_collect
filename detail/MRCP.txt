MRCP: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, an application of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a> (magnetic resonance imaging) to the hepatobiliary and pancreatic system. An MRCP uses an MRI machine with special software to obtain images comparable to the cholangiogram and pancreatogram obtained by the more invasive approach with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ercp/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">ERCP</a> (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) without the added risks of sedation, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pancreatitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pancreatitis</a>, and perforation. MRCP may be useful, for example, in cases with unexplained <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abdominal pain</a> in which there is a low or uncertain probability of hepatobiliary pathology such as retained stones in the common bile duct, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>, biliary dyskinesia, or idiopathic pancreatitis.
MRCP in another context can stand for something quite different. MRCP(UK) means Member, Royal College of Physicians (in the UK).
