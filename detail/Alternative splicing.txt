Alternative splicing: A mechanism by which different forms of mature mRNAs (messengers RNAs) are generated from the same gene. Alternative splicing is a regulatory mechanism by which variations in the incorporation of the exons, or coding regions, into mRNA leads to the production of more than one related protein, or isoform.
