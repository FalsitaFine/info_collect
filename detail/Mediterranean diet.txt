Mediterranean diet: A diet traditionally followed in Greece, Crete, southern France, and parts of Italy that emphasizes fruits and vegetables, nuts, grains, olive oil (as opposed to butter) and grilled or steamed chicken and seafood (as opposed to red meat). Plus a glass or two of red wine.  To be exact, there is not merely one Mediterranean diet.   What is eaten varies significantly from one Mediterranean country to another.   There also are major differences in diet between some regions within a country,   as in Italy.
