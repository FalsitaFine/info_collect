Lithotripsy, percutaneous nephro- (PNL): A technique for removing large and/or dense stones and staghorn stones.
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8339" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">PNL</a> is done via a port created by puncturing the kidney through the skin and enlarging the access port to 1 cm (about 3/8 inch) in diameter. There is no surgical incision. PNL is done under anesthesia and real-time live x-ray control (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3488" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">fluoroscopy</a>). Because x-rays are involved, a super-specialist in radiology (an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=34211" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">interventional radiologist</a>) may perform this part of the procedure. The urologist (an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8326" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">endourologist</a>, another super-specialist) then inserts instruments via this port into the kidney to break up the stone and remove most of the debris from the stone.
