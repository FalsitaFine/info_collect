Hemoglobin S: The most common type of abnormal hemoglobin and the basis of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11232">sickle 
cell trait</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9377">sickle cell anemia</a>. 
Hemoglobin S differs from normal adult hemoglobin (called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3690">hemoglobin A</a>) only by a single <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2222">amino acid</a> substitution (a valine replacing a glutamine in the 6th position of the beta chain of globin). Recognition of this tiny change in the hemoglobin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4418">molecule</a> marked the opening of molecular medicine.
