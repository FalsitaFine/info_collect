Heat index: The temperature the body feels when heat and humidity are combined. The body dissipates heat by varying the rate and depth of blood circulation, by losing water through the skin and sweat glands, and as a last resort, by panting, when blood is heated above 98.6 F (37  C). Sweating cools the body through evaporation. However, high relative humidity retards evaporation, robbing the body of its ability to cool itself. When heat gain exceeds the level the body can remove, body temperature begins to rise, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthermia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heat-related illnesses</a> and disorders may develop.
