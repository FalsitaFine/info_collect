Cystitis, interstitial (IC): Disease that involves
inflammation or irritation of the bladder wall. This inflammation can lead to scarring and
stiffening of the bladder, and even ulcerations and bleeding. Diagnosis is based on
symptoms, findings on <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2903" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cystoscopy</a> and biopsy, and eliminating other treatable causes such
as infection. Because doctors do not know what causes IC, treatments are aimed at
relieving symptoms. Most people are helped for variable periods of time by one or a
combination of treatments.
