<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/congestive_heart_failure_chf_overview/article.htm">Heart failure</a>: Inability of the heart to 
keep up with the demands on it and, specifically, failure of the 
heart to pump 
blood with normal 
efficiency. When this occurs, 
the heart is unable to provide adequate blood 
flow to other organs such as the brain, liver and kidneys. Heart 
failure may be due to failure of the right or left or both 
ventricles. The signs and symptoms depend upon which side of the 
heart is failing. They can include shortness of breath (dyspnea), 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm">asthma</a> due to the heart (cardiac asthma), pooling of blood (stasis) in 
the general body (systemic) circulation or in the liver's (portal) 
circulation, swelling (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm">edema</a>), 
blueness or duskiness (cyanosis), and enlargement (hypertrophy) of 
the heart. 
There 
are many causes of congestive heart failure including: (1) coronary 
artery disease leading to heart attacks and heart muscle weakness, 
(2) 
primary heart muscle weakness from viral infections or toxins such as 
prolonged alcohol exposure, (3) heart valve disease causing heart 
muscle 
weakness due to too much leaking of blood or heart muscle stiffness 
from a blocked valve, and (4) hypertension (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm">high blood pressure</a>). 
Rarer causes include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthyroidism/article.htm">hyperthyroidism</a> (high thyroid hormone), vitamin 
deficiency, and excess amphetamine ("speed") use. 
The aim of therapy 
is to improve the pumping function of the 
heart.  General treatment includes salt restriction, diuretics (to 
get rid of excess fluid), 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/digoxin/article.htm">digoxin</a> (to strengthen the heart), and other medications. A drug called spironolactone has been found to be a major help in treating congestive heart failure  Its beneficial effects are additive to those from  ACE inhibitors, another class of drugs commonly relied on in treating heart failure. A pacemaker-like device is also now available to treat heart failure. The implantable device  delivers synchronized electrical stimulation to three chambers of the heart, enabling the heart to pump blood more efficiently throughout the body.
