Mute: A mute is a person who does not speak, 
either from an inability to speak or an unwillingness to 
speak. The term "mute" is specifically
applied to a person who, due to profound congenital (or 
early) <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm">deafness</a>, is unable to use articulate language and 
so is deaf-mute. A mute in speech is a letter that
is silent and also an element of speech formed by a 
position of the mouth which stops the passage of the 
breath, such as the letters p, b, d, k, and t. The word 
"mute" comes from the Latin "mutus" meaning unable to 
speak.
