Cephalgia, histamine:  A 
distinctive syndrome of headaches, also known as cluster 
headache or migrainous neuralgia. The common pattern of 
cluster headache is termed "episodic" and is characterized 
by 1-3 short attacks of pain each day around the eyes, 
clustered over a stretch of 1-2 months, followed by a pain-
free breathing period (average: a year). The other main 
pattern of cluster headache is termed "chronic" (and is 
also known as chronic migrainous neuralgia). It may come 
out of the blue or emerge several years after an episodic 
pattern. It is characterized by the absence of sustained 
periods of remission. The episodic and acute forms of 
cluster headache may transform into the other, so it seems 
that they are merely different-appearing patterns of one 
and the same disease. On the other hand, cluster headache 
looks different and distinct from migraine-for example, 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/propranolol/article.htm">propranolol</a> is effective for migraine but not cluster 
headache while <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lithium/article.htm">lithium</a> benefits cluster headache syndrome 
but not migraine-although the mechanisms underlying cluster 
headache and migraine may have a degree of commonality. 
Cluster headache has gone by a bevy of other names 
including Raeder's syndrome, sphenopalatine neuralgia, 
ciliary neuralgia, erythroprosopalgia and vidian neuralgia.
