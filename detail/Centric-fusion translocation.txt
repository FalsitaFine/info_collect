Centric-fusion translocation: A type of chromosome rearrangement, also called a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5388" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Robertsonian translocation</a>, in which there is fusion of an entire long arm of one <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2123" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">acrocentric chromosome</a> with a similarly intact long arm of another acrocentric chromosome. The short arms of the chromosomes participating in the translocation are usually lost.  Acrocentric chromosomes have their <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2668" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">centromere</a> near but not at the very end of the chromosome. In humans, chromosomes 13-15, 21 and 22 are acrocentric. Centric-fusion translocations are relatively common. In balanced form, they take the place of two acrocentric chromosomes and result in no problems. But in unbalanced form, centric-fusion translocations account for some cases of the trisomy 13 (Patau) syndrome and trisomy 21 (Down) syndrome.
