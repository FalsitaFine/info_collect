Microduplication 22q11.2 syndrome: A syndrome due to duplication of a tiny part of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18598" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">chromosome band</a> 22q11.2. Features of the syndrome include the appearance of widely spaced eyes and superior placement of eyebrows; downslanting palpebral fissures (eye slits); mild micrognathia (small <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11995" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">chin</a>) and retrognathia (recessed chin); and a long, narrow face. The microduplication arises because chromosome band 22q11.2 is predisposed to rearrangement due to misalignment of what are called low-copy repeats -- a small number of adjacent copies of an identical pattern of nucleotides in the DNA. The microduplication may be detected by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3998" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">interphase</a> fluorescence <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3988" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">in situ hybridization</a> (FISH). The size of the microduplications range from 34 Mb to 6 Mb.
