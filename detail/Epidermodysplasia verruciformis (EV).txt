Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV): a rare genetic condition that leads to susceptibility to infection of the skin by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hpv_infection_human_papillomavirus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">human papillomaviruses</a> (HPVs) and the development of squamous cells carcinomas (a type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>) of the skin. Symptoms include flat-to-raised, wart-like <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bumps_on_skin/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">bumps</a> and reddish-brown raised plaques on the trunk, hands, upper and lower extremities, and the face. Patients with this condition are typically infected with multiple types of HPV. The genetic defect responsible for 
epidermodysplasia verruciformis leads to a defective immune response to

Most cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means that both parents must carry a defective copy of the gene for the offspring to develop the condition.
