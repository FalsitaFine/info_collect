Bridge: A set of one or more false teeth supported by a 
metal framework, used to replace one or more missing teeth.
Bridges may be fixed or removable. A fixed bridge (a partial 
denture) is a prosthetic replacement of one or more missing teeth; it 
is cemented (or otherwise attached) to the neighboring teeth or may 
be implanted in the space. A removable bridge (partial denture) is a 
prosthetic replacement of one or more missing teeth on a framework 
that can be removed by the wearer.
