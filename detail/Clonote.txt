Clonote: The first cell produced by the combination of a nucleus and an enucleated ovum that launches the process of somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). As opposed to the zygote, the first cell resulting from fertilization.
The term "clonote" was coined to connote the fundamental difference between in vitro fertilization (IVF) and SCNT. IVF (and the natural reproductive process) can lead to the production of a zygote and, in time, a human being whereas SCNT cannot.
To our knowledge, the first appearance of the term "clonote" in print was in 2004 in an invited editorial by Paul R. McHugh (Zygote and "Clonote" - The Ethical Use of Embryonic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stem_cells/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Stem Cells</a>. New England J Med 351:209-211). The term was created by merging clon(e) and (zyg)ote.
