Discordance: 1.  The presence of any given condition such as HIV in only one member of a couple. 2. In genetics, the presence of a phenotype such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">asthma</a> in only one members of a twin pair. 3. In clinical care, lack of agreement between physician and patient.<br>
In all sense, disconcordance is as opposed to concordance. From dis- + the Latin concordare, to agree = not to agree.</br>
