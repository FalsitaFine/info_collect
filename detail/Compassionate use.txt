Compassionate use: Term formerly used in the US for a method of providing experimental therapeutics prior to final FDA approval for use in humans. This procedure was used with very sick individuals who have no other treatment options. Often, case-by-case approval was obtained from the FDA for "compassionate use" of a drug or therapy.  The use of this term is now discouraged by the FDA.
