Studies of NSE as a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> marker have concentrated primarily on patients with neuroblastoma and small cell lung <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a>. Measurement of NSE levels in patients with these two diseases can provide information about the extent of the disease and the patient's prognosis (outlook), as well as about the patient's response to treatment.
