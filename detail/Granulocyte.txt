Granulocyte: A type of white blood cell that is filled with microscopic granules, little sacs containing enzymes that digest microorganisms. Granulocytes are part of the innate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3907" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">immune system</a>, and they have somewhat nonspecific, broad-based activity. They do not respond exclusively to specific antigens, as do B-cells and T-cells. Neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils are all types of granulocytes, and their names are derived from the staining features of their granules in the laboratory, a naming scheme that dates back to a time when certain structures could be identified in cells by histochemistry, but the functions of these intracellular structures were still not known.
