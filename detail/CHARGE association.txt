CHARGE association: A constellation of congenital malformations (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_defects/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">birth defects</a>). The name of the condition is an acronym of some of the most frequent features:
<ul>
<li>C = Coloboma (cleft) of the eye (80% of cases)  and Cranial nerve abnormalities, <li>H = Heart malformation, <li>A = Choanal Atresia (blockage of the nasal passageways) (58% of cases), <li>R = Retardation of growth after birth (87% of cases) and Retardation of development (94% of cases),
<li>G = Genital hypoplasia (underdevelopment) in males (75% of cases) and urinary tract malformations, and
<li>E = Ear malformations and/or deafness (88% of cases).

In addition, there may be cleft lip or palate; micrognathia (small chin); facial palsy; and esophageal atresia (a blind-ending to the food tube) or tracheoesophageal fistula (a connection between the wind pipe and the food tube). Other problems reported in children with the CHARGE association include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/microcephaly/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">microcephaly</a> (abnormally small head), ptosis (drooping) of the eyelids, trouble breathing (due to the choanal atresia), feeding problems in infancy, omphalocele, anal stenosis (narrowing) or atresia (blockage), and deficiency of growth hormone.
