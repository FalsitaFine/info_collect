Negative calorie diet: The Negative calorie diet is a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a> concept based upon the premise that consumption of foods with a "negative caloric effect" (meaning that the calories burned by chewing, digesting, and eliminating the food are greater than those contained in the food itself) will lead to rapid weight loss of up to two pounds per day. Even if this were true, this rate of weight loss is dangerous and unhealthy. The negative calorie diet has not been recommended by medical professionals as a weight loss plan and is not considered a healthy way to lose weight. Instead, it is considered to be an unhealthy, "fad" diet that may contribute to the cycle of weight loss and gain known as "yo-yo" dieting.
