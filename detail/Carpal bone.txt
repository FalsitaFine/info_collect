Carpal bone: One of the wrist bones. There are eight carpal bones that are arranged in two rows. The carpal bones articulate (come together to form a joint) proximally (on their near ends) with the long bones of the forearm -- the radius and, indirectly, with the ulna -- and distally (on their far ends) with the five metacarpal bones that make up the palm.
The bones of the proximal (near) row of carpals are called the radial, intermediate, ulnar, and accessory bones, while those of the distal (far) row are termed the first, second, third, and fourth carpal bones.
