MME: Metallomembrane endopeptidase, also known as membrane metalloendopeptidase. MME is also called CALLA (Common Acute Lymphocytic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leukemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Leukemia</a> antigen) a cell surface marker for the most common form of acute lymphocytic leukemia. There is however some confusion regarding the specificity of this marker. MME is identical to neutral endopeptidase and is the target of antibodies directed against podocytes- cells which line the glomerulus or primary filtration site in the kidney. Mutations in the gene for MME that shorten it can cause a kidney disease called membranous nephropathy. The gene for MME is on chromosome 3 in the region 3q21-q27. MME is also synonymous with CD10, membrane metalloendopeptidase, enkephalinase, and neprilysin.
