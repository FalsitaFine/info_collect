Migraine, ophthalmic:  Migraine involving the 
eyes but without <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm">headache</a>.
Migraine, due to a spasm of blood vessels in the brain, 
usually causes a
headache. Flashes of light may appear as jagged lines or 
"heat waves" in one
or both
eyes and often last 10-20 minutes, sometimes without a 
headache. This is
termed
ophthalmic migraine, or migraine without headache.
