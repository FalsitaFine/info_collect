Kyphoscoliosis: A combination of outward curvature (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kyphosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">kyphosis</a>) and lateral curvature (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scoliosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scoliosis</a>) of the spine. Kyphoscoliosis can be due to musculoskeletal disease or to unknown causes. Treatment includes physical therapy and wearing a back brace, and in some cases surgery. Surgery for kyphoscoliosis may involve inserting a metal rod in the spine and restructuring some bones, and it is usually followed by wearing a back cast and then a back brace for some time.
