Gluten enteropathy: A condition, also called celiac
sprue, in which the absorption of food nutrients through the small intestine is impaired by an immune (allergic) reaction to gluten, a protein found in wheat or related grains and many other foods. Frequent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm">diarrhea</a> and weight loss can be symptoms. A skin condition called dermatitis herpetiformis can be associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/celiac_disease_gluten_enteropathy/article.htm">celiac sprue</a>. The most
accurate test for the condition is a biopsy of the involved small bowel. Treatment is avoidance of gluten in the diet. For stubborn sprue, medications are used.
