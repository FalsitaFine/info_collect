Mycobacterium leprae: The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10960">bacillus</a> responsible for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4132">leprosy</a> (Hansen disease). Mycobacterium leprae is an obligate <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4769">parasite</a> that has to live 
within cells. There it is able to withstand the onslaught of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15392">enzymes</a> 
and other forces by virtue of possessing a peculiarly resistant waxy 
coat and thanks also to its association with lowered cellular 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3908">immunity</a>.  See also: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3652">Hansen disease</a>.
