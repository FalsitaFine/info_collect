<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_facts_stages/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breast cancer</a>.

About 15% to 20% of women with breast cancer have such a family history of the disease, clearly reflecting the participation of inherited (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">genetic</a>) components in the development of some breast cancers.
