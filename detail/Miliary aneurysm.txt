Miliary aneurysm: An aneurysm that 
is tiny like a millet seed.  Miliary aneurysms tend to 
affect minute arteries in the brain and, in the eye, in the 
retina. One of the botanical borrowings by medicine, "miliary" refers 
to the millet seed, millet being a small-grained rather inferior 
cereal grass.  Its seed measures about 2 millimeters in 
diameter.
