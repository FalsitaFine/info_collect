Diagnostic mammogram: An X-ray of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breast</a> done to evaluate:
<ul>
<li>Abnormalities seen or suspected on a prior screening <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mammogram/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">mammogram</a>;
<li>Subjective or objectives abnormalities in the breast such as a lump, pain, thickening, nipple discharge or a inexplicable change in breast size or shape;
<li>Breasts for which it is difficult to obtain a clear X-ray by a screening mammogram because of special circumstances such as breast implants.
