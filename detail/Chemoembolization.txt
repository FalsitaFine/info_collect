Chemoembolization: Chemoembolization is a procedure in which anticancer drugs are administered directly into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> and the blood supply to the tumor is then blocked by injection of an embolizing- or blocking agent. This permits a much higher concentration of drugs to be in contact with the tumor for a longer period of time, while depriving the tumor of oxygen and nutrients. The procedure is used to treat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> originating in the liver (primary <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">liver cancer</a>) as well as cancer that has metastasized (spread) to the liver from another area.
