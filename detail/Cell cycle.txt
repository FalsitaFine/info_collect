Cell cycle: The sequence of events within the cell between <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4405" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">mitotic</a> (cell) divisions. The cell cycle is conventionally divided into five phases: G0 (the gap); G1, (the first gap); S (the synthesis phase, during which the DNA is synthesized and replicated); G2 (the second gap); and M (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4404" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">mitosis</a>). Cells that are not destined to divide again are considered to be in the G0 phase. The transition from G0 to G1 is thought to commit the cell to completing the cell cycle by dividing.
