Electrolysis: Permanent removal of body hair, including the hair root, with an electronic device. Although <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolysis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">electrolysis</a> is promoted as a permanent process, many people find that hair does grow back (albeit slowly) after electrolysis. Electrolysis may be done by a dermatologist, by an electrolysis technician, or by a facial technologist or esthetician.
