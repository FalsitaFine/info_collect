Arteriosclerotic aneurysm: A 
localized widening (aneurysm) of a vessel that occurs 
because the vessel wall is weakened by arteriosclerosis. An aneurysm is a localized widening (dilatation) of an artery, vein, or the 
heart.  At the area of an aneurysm, there is typically a 
bulge and the wall is weakened and may rupture. 
The word "aneurysm" comes from the Greek "aneurysma" meaning "a 
widening."  Also called an atherosclerotic aneurysm.
