Eugenics: A pseudoscience with the stated aim of improving the genetic constitution of the human species by selective breeding. Eugenics is from a Greek word meaning 'normal genes.' The use of Albert Einstein's sperm to conceive a child by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7001" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">artificial insemination</a> would represent an attempt at positive eugenics. The Nazis notoriously engaged in negative eugenics by genocide in World War II. It is important to note that no experiment in eugenics has ever been shown to result in measurable improvements in human health.
