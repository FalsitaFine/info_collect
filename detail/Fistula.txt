Fistula: An abnormal passageway in the body. The fistula may go from the body surface into a blind pouch or into an internal organ or go between two internal organs. For a common example, an anal fistula has an opening in the skin near the anus that leads into a blind pouch or may connect through a tunnel with the rectal canal. For a rare example, a gastropericardial fistula is a passageway between the stomach and the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/pericardial_sac_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">pericardial sac</a> (that surrounds the heart). There are numerous types of fistulas. They are usually designated by the organs or parts they connect (anovaginal, bronchoesophageal, etc.).
