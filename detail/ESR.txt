ESR:
Abbreviation for erythrocyte <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sedimentation_rate/article.htm">sedimentation rate</a>, a blood test that detects and 
monitors inflammation in the body. It measures the rate at which red 
blood cells (RBCs) in a test tube separate from blood serum over 
time, becoming sediment in the bottom of the test tube. The 
sedimentation rate increases with more inflammation. Also commonly called the 
sed rate.
