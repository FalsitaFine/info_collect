Latham bowl: A blood-processing instrument that uses centrifugal force to separate blood into its components: red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma and platelets. Developed by Allen (Jack) Latham Jr. who had grown up on a farm, so the design "was like a milk separator." The Latham bowl revolutionalized the way blood was collected and processed.
