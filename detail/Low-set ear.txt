Low-set ear: A minor anomaly in which the ear is situated below the normal location. Technically, the ear is low-set when the helix of the ear meets the cranium at a level below that of a horizontal plane through both inner canthi (the inside corners of the eyes). The presence of two or more minor anomalies such as this one in a child increases the probability that the child has a major malformation.
