Body habitus: The physique or body build. For example: "The metabolic complications most commonly reported
(with HIV infection) are hyperlipidemia, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperglycemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hyperglycemia</a> and altered body habitus."  The term "body habitus" is somewhat redundant, since habitus by itself means "physique or body build."
