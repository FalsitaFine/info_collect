Entomophobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of insects. Sufferers experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a> even though they realize that most insects pose no threat. To avoid insects, they may frequently clean rooms and carpets, sweep hallways, spray insect-killer or seal off doors and windows. Entophobia (insect phobia) includes acarophobia (mites: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/scabies/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">scabies</a>) and arachnophobia (spiders). A true insect phobia is defined by a persistent irrational fear of and compelling desire to avoid insects, mites, spiders, or similar phobic objects and significant distress from the disturbance despite recognition by the phobic person that their fear is inappropriate, unreasonable, and excessive. "Entomophobia" is derived from the Greek "entomos" (insect) and "phobos" (fear). The study of insects is called entomology.
