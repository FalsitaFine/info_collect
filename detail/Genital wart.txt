Genital wart: A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warts_common_warts/article.htm">wart</a> in the moist 
skin of the genitals or around the anus. Genital <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warts_common_warts/article.htm">warts</a> are due to  
a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3813">human papillomavirus</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3807">HPV</a>). The HPVs, including those that cause genital <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warts_common_warts/article.htm">warts</a>, are transmitted through sexual contact. HPV can also be transmitted from mother to baby during childbirth. Most people 
infected with HPV have no symptoms, but these viruses increase a 
woman's risk for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cervical_cancer/article.htm">cancer of the cervix</a>. HPV infection is 
the most common sexually transmitted disease in the US. It is also 
the leading cause of abnormal PAP smears and pre-cancerous changes of 
the cervix in women. There is no cure for HPV infection, although 
anti-viral medications can reduce outbreaks and topical preparations 
can speed healing. Once contracted, the virus can stay with a person 
for life. Also called condyloma acuminatum, condylomata.
