limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalopathy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">encephalopathy</a>, or LATE. The condition arises from an abnormal folding of a protein called TDP-43 (transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa). TDP-43 normally functions to control gene expression in the brain and other areas of the body. This new pathway to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">dementia</a> primarily affects adults in the "oldest old" category, over age 85. It is thought to affect many mental capabilities but may progress more slowly than <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alzheimers_disease_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">Alzheimer's disease</a>.
