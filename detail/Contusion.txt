Contusion: Another name for a bruise. What is a bruise
? A bruise, or contusion, is caused when blood vessels are damaged or broken as the result
of a blow to the skin (be it bumping against something or hitting yourself with a hammer).
The raised area of a bump or bruise results from blood leaking from these injured blood
vessels into the tissues as well as from the body's response to the injury. A
purplish, flat bruise that occurs when blood leaks out into the top layers of skin is
referred to as an ecchymosis.
