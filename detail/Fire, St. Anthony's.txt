Fire, St. Anthony's: The intensely painful burning sensation in the limbs and extremities caused by ergot, the consequence of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3527">fungus</a> (Claviceps purpurea) that contaminates rye and wheat.
The fungus produces substances (alkaloids) termed ergotamines that constrict blood vessels and cause the muscle of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5918">uterus</a> to contract. The ergotamines have been much used (and been very useful) for the treatment of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4385">migraine</a>. They have also been used (and misused) as abortifacients (agents of abortion).
