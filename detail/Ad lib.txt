Ad lib: Abbreviation for the Latin "ad libitum" 
meaning "at pleasure" and
"at one's pleasure, as much as one desires, to the full 
extent of one's
wishes." Sometimes seen on a prescription or doctor's 
order. For example,
during an overnight fast when the patient is not to eat any 
food but can
have water, the doctor's order might read: "Water ad lib" 
(water as
desired).
