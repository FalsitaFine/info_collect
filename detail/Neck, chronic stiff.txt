Neck, chronic stiff: Also called torticollis or spasmodic torticollis, this is the most common of the focal dystonias: a state of abnormal -- either excessive of inadequate -- muscle tone. In this disorder, the muscles in the neck that control the position of the head are affected, causing the head to twist and turn to one side. In addition, the
head may be pulled forward or backward.
