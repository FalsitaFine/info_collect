Anthracycline: A member of a family of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">chemotherapy</a> drugs that are also antibiotics.
The anthracyclines act to prevent cell division by disrupting the structure of the DNA and terminate its function. They do so in two ways: (1) they intercalate into the base pairs in the DNA minor grooves; and (2) they cause free radical damage of the ribose in the DNA.  The anthracyclines are frequently used in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leukemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">leukemia</a>  therapy. The anthracyclines include daunorubicin (Cerubidine), doxorubicin (Adriamycin, Rubex), epirubicin (Ellence, Pharmorubicin), and idarubicin (Idamycin).
