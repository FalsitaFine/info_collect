Colon cancer and polyps: Benign tumors of the large
intestine are called polyps. Malignant tumors of the large intestine are called cancers.
Benign polyps do not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body. Benign
polyps can be easily removed during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/colonoscopy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">colonoscopy</a>, and are not life threatening. If benign
polyps are not removed from the large intestine, they can become malignant (cancerous)
over time. Most of the cancers of the large intestine are believed to have developed from
polyps.
