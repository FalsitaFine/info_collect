Aromatase inhibitor: A drug that inhibits the enzyme aromatase and by that means lowers the level of the estrogen <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/estradiol/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">estradiol</a>. Aromatase inhibitors represent a class of antiestrogens.
 Aromatase catalyzes the conversion of testosterone (an androgen) to estradiol (an estrogen) in many tissues including the adrenal glands, ovaries, placenta, testicles, adipose (fat) tissue, and brain. Estrogen is produced directly by the ovaries and is also made by the body using aromatase. Aromatase inhibitors cannot do anything about estrogen produced by the ovaries, but they do interfere with the body's use of aromatase. 
The growth of many <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breast</a> cancers is promoted by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/estrogens_conjugated-vaginal_cream/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">estrogens</a>. Most estrogen after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">menopause</a> comes from the action of aromatase. Aromatase inhibitors may therefore be used to treat estrogen-dependent tumors after the menopause. Aromatase inhibitors  are used mostly in women who have reached menopause, when the ovaries are no longer producing estrogen.  
The aromatase inhibitors approved by the US Food and Drug Administration include anastrazole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/letrozole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">letrozole</a> (Femara).
