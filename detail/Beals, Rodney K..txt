Beals, Rodney K.: (1931- ) American orthopaedic surgeon who  described a number of congenital malformation syndromes. After graduating from the University of Oregon Medical School in 1956, Dr. Beals joined the faculty of the Oregon Health Sciences University in 1961 and became head of the Division of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation in 1981. Dr. Beals' interests in genetic diseases arose by accident. Because of crowded quarters, Beals and Frederick Hecht, a medical geneticist, were assigned to share an office in the 1960s at the medical school in Oregon. Sitting at adjacent desks in the same small room for a number of years, they began sharing their interests and collaborating in clinical research.
