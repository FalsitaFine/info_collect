Disease, Stein-Leventhal: Known descriptively as
polycystic ovarian (PCO) disease, this syndrome is basically a hormonal problem that causes women to have various symptoms including:     <ol>
<li>Irregular or no periods </li>
<li><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acne/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Acne</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Obesity</a>, and </li>
<li>Excess hair growth. </li>
</ol>
All women with PCO have irregular or no menses. Women with PCO do not ovulate (do not release an egg every month).  Women with PCO are at a higher risk for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">high blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart disease</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> of the uterus (endometrial cancer). Much of this risk can be reversed by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">exercise</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a>. It is also important for women with PCO to have regular periods -- if a woman does not have regular periods, her risk of cancer of the uterus (endometrial cancer) rises -- so medication is generally prescribed to induce regular periods. For acne or excess hair growth, a water pill (diuretic) called     <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/spironolactone/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">spironolactone</a> can help. For PCO women who desire <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a>, a medication called clomiphene (CLOMID) can be used to induce ovulation (cause egg production).  A type of surgery called a "wedge resection," in
which a piece of the ovary is removed, seems to help some women.
