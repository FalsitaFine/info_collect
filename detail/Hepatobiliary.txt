Hepatobiliary: Having to do with the liver plus the gallbladder, bile ducts, or bile. For example, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a> (magnetic resonance imaging) can be applied to the hepatobiliary system. Hepatobiliary makes sense since "hepato-" refers to the liver and "-biliary" refers to the gallbladder, bile ducts, or bile.
