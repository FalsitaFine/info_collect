Bile duct cancer: An uncommon type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> that arises from the bile duct, the tube that connects the liver and the gallbladder to the small intestine.     The part of the bile duct that is outside the liver is called the extrahepatic bile duct. Bile, a fluid made by the liver that breaks down fats during digestion, is stored in the gallbladder. When food is being broken down in the intestines, bile is released from the gallbladder through the bile duct to the first part of the small intestine.
