Acrodermatitis enteropathica: An historic model for 
the
therapy of genetic disease. In an era (the 1950s) when inherited 
disorders were usually
seen as hopeless, this progressive hereditary (autosomal recessive) 
disease of children
was found treatable. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is characterized by 
the simultaneous
occurrence of skin inflammation (dermatitis) and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm">diarrhea</a>. The skin 
on the cheeks, elbows
and knees and tissue about the mouth and anus are inflamed. There is 
also balding of the
scalp, eyebrows and lashes, delayed wound healing and recurrent 
bacterial and fungal
infections due to immune deficiency.
