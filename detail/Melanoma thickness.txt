Melanoma thickness: A method for determining the prognosis (outlook) with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/melanoma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">melanoma</a>. The thickness of a melanoma is related to the 5-year survival rate after surgical removal of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a>. Also called Breslow thickness.  Named for the physician Alexander Breslow who in 1975 observed that as the thickness of the tumor increases, the chance of survival goes down. For example, a thickness of the melanoma of less than 1.0 millimeters is associated with a 5-year survival of 97% of patients whereas a tumor thickness of more than 8.0 millimeters is associated with 5-year survival of 32%.
