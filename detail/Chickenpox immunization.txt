The vaccination currently involves two shots, the first dose (shot) at age 12 through 15 months and the second dose (shot) at age 4 through 6 years. The second dose may be given at an earlier age if it is given at least 3 months after the first dose. People 13 years of age and older who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine should get two doses, at least 28 days apart.
