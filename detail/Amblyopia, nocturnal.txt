Amblyopia, nocturnal:  Amblyopia refers to blindness so nocturnal amblyopia is, literally, night blindness. Listed in medical dictionaries under "Nyctalopia" from the Greek nyct (night) + aloas (obscure or blind) + opsis (vision), the condition 
involves impaired vision in dim light and in the dark due 
to impaired function of specific vision cells (namely, the rods) 
in the retina.
Night blindness, a classic finding in vitamin A deficiency, was discovered by the English physician William Heberden (1710-1801). (Heberden also described other medical disorders of importance including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/angina_symptoms/article.htm">angina</a> 
(chest pain that is often severe and crushing, due to an 
inadequate supply of oxygen to the heart muscle) and Heberden's 
nodes, bumps around the small joints due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoarthritis/article.htm">osteoarthritis</a>.) 
Night blindness (nyctalopia) is also called day sight and 
nyctanopia.
