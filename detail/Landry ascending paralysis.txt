Landry ascending paralysis: A particularly 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6912">virulent</a> form of  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8009">Guillain-Barre syndrome</a>. The disorder often begins with a flu-like illness that brings on general physical weakness, but is then characterized by rapidly 
progressing paralysis that starts in the legs and arms, and 
may move on (ascend) to affect the breathing muscles and 
face. As with less severe forms of Guillain-Barre, the 
exact cause is not yet known but presumed to be viral 
and/or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.comhttps://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm02">autoimmune</a>. Hospitalization is usually required, and 
treatment is by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4937">plasmapheresis</a> or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4021">intravenous</a> gamma 
globulin (IVIG).
