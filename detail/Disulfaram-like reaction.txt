Disulfaram-like reaction: a process in the body that produces symptoms similar to those that occur when alcohol is consumed after taking disulfaram (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/disulfiram-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Antabuse</a>). <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/disulfiram-oral/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">Disulfiram</a> is an oral drug used for treating <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_abuse_and_alcoholism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">alcoholism</a> that causes unpleasant symptoms when alcohol is consumed. This happens because alcohol is first converted in the body into acetaldehyde by an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase. Another enzyme known as acetaldehyde dehydrogenase then converts acetaldehyde into acetic acid. Disulfiram prevents acetaldehyde dehydrogenase from converting acetaldehyde into acetic acid, leading to a buildup of acetaldehyde levels in the blood. These high levels of acetaldehyde levels cause unpleasant symptoms after drinking alcohol such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">low blood pressure</a> (hyoptension), severe flushing, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/palpitations_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">palpitations</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thirst/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">thirst</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chest pain</a>, and others.
