Axial tomography, computerized: Pictures of structures within the body created by a computer that takes the data from multiple X-ray images and turns them in pictures. The CAT (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2812" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">computerized axial tomography</a>) scan can reveal some soft-tissue and other structures that cannot be seen in conventional X-rays. Using the same dosage of radiation as that of an ordinary X-ray machine, an entire slice of the body can be made visible with about 100 times more clarity with the CAT scan.
