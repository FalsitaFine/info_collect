Homozygote: A person who has two identical forms of a particular gene, one inherited from each parent. For example, a girl who is a homozygote for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cystic_fibrosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cystic fibrosis</a> (CF) received the cystic fibrosis gene from both of her parents and therefore has cystic fibrosis. The opposite of a homozygote is a heterozygote, a person who has two different forms of a particular gene. For example, the father and mother of a cystic fibrosis child are heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis (CF). Each carries one normal gene and one cystic fibrosis gene but has no signs or symptoms of the disease.
