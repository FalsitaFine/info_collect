Insomnia, transient: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insomnia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Insomnia</a> that usually lasts less than a week and does not recur. If it recurs from time to time, the insomnia is considered intermittent. If the insomnia affects most nights and lasts a month or more, it is considered chronic insomnia.
Transient insomnia may not require treatment. For example, if it is due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/jet_lag/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">jet lag</a>, the biological clock will return to normal on its own. Short-acting sleeping pills may improve <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a> and next-day alertness but, as with all drugs, there are potential side effects.  The use of over-the-counter sleep medicines is not usually recommended for insomnia.
