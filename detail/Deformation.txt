Deformation: A change from the normal size or shape of an anatomic structure due to mechanical forces that distort an otherwise normal structure. Deformations occur most often late in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm">pregnancy</a> or during 
delivery. A twin pregnancy can cause deformations due to crowding of the twins late in pregnancy. A well-known example of a deformation is molding of the head of a baby born by vaginal delivery. There are usually no significant lasting effects of a deformation. The effects are typically temporary. 
A deformation is different from a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=22055">malformation</a> in timing 
and impact. In a malformation, the development of a structure is arrested, delayed, or misdirected early in embryonic life and the effect is permanent.
