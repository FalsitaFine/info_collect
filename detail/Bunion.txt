Bunion: A localized, painful swelling at the base of the big toe due to new bone formation. The affected toe is often curved outward. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bunions/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Bunions</a> are frequently associated with inflammation of the nearby bursa (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/acute_and_chronic_bursitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bursitis</a>) and degenerative joint disease (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoarthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">osteoarthritis</a>). Bunions most commonly affect women, particularly those who wear tight-fitting shoes and high heels. Treatment includes rest, a change in shoes, foot supports, medications, or surgery.
