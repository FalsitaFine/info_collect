IPV: Inactivated polio vaccine. The polio virus in 
IPV has been inactivated (killed). The inactivated polio vaccine 
(IPV) is also called the Salk vaccine after the late American
physician-virologist Jonas Salk.
The vaccines available for vaccination against polio are the IPV 
(inactivated polio vaccine) and the OPV (oral polio vaccine).
IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) is given as a shot in the arm or 
leg. 
OPV (oral polio vaccine) is the preferred vaccine for most 
children. As its name suggests, it is given by mouth. Infants and 
children should be given four doses of OPV. The doses are given at 2 
months, 4 months, 6-18 months and 4-6 years of age. 
Persons allergic to eggs or the drugs neomycin or streptomycin 
should receive OPV, not the injectable IPV. Conversely, IPV should be
given if the vaccine recipient is on long-term steroid (cortisone) 
therapy, has cancer, or is on <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chemotherapy/article.htm">chemotherapy</a> or if a household member 
has AIDS or there is an unimmunized adult in the house.
