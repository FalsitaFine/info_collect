Angle-closure glaucoma, acute: Increased pressure  in the front chamber (anterior chamber) of the eye due to sudden (acute)  blockage of the normal circulation of fluid within the eye. The block takes place  at the angle of the anterior chamber formed by its junction of the cornea  with the iris. This angle can be seen by looking at one's eye  from the side with a slit lamp. Angle-closure <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">glaucoma</a> is more likely to affect people born with a  narrow angle. People of Asian and Eskimo ancestry are at higher risk of  developing it. Age and family history are risk factors. It occurs in older  women more often than others. When the pupil of the eye is wide open  (dilated), the iris is retracted and thickened and it blocks the canal of Schlemm,  a key component of the drainage pathway for fluid within the eye. Blocking  the drainage canal of Schlemm sends the pressure within the eye shooting  up. There is an abrupt increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) due to the  buildup of aqueous (fluid) in the eye. The high pressure can damage the optic  nerve (the nerve to the eye) and lead to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">blindness</a>. The elevated pressure is  best detected before the appearance of symptoms. That is why when the  eyes are dilated in a doctor's office, eye pressures are   checked. When symptoms of acute angle glaucoma do develop, they include  severe eye and facial pain, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">nausea and vomiting</a>, decreased vision, blurred  vision and seeing haloes around light. The eye in a far advanced case  of angle closure glaucoma appears red with a steamy (clouded) cornea and a  fixed (nonreactive) dilated pupil.  Acute angle-closure glaucoma  is an emergency because optic nerve damage and vision loss can occur within  hours of the onset of the problem. Administering medications to lower  the pressure within the eye is done first. In the past, a piece of the iris was  then surgically removed in a procedure called an iridectomy to make a hole  in the iris and create a channel (other than the canal of Schlemm) to permit  the free flow of fluid. Today a comparable procedure can be done by laser to  burn a small hole in the iris to keep the intraocular pressure within  normal limits.
