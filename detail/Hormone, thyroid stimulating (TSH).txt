Hormone, thyroid stimulating (TSH): A hormone produced by the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4915" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">pituitary gland</a> at the base of the brain in response to signals from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3866" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">hypothalamus</a> gland in the brain. TSH promotes the growth of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5778" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">thyroid gland</a> in the neck and stimulates it to produce more <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5780" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">thyroid hormones</a>. When there is an excessive amount of thyroid hormones, the pituitary gland stops producing TSH, reducing thyroid hormone production. This mechanism maintains a relatively constant level of thyroid hormones circulating in the blood. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5781" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Thyroid stimulating hormone</a> is also known as  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5790" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">thyrotropin</a>.
