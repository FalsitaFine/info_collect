Cerebral cortex: A thin mantle of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3635" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">gray matter</a> about the size of a formal dinner napkin covering the surface of each cerebral hemisphere. The cerebral cortex is crumpled and folded, forming numerous convolutions (gyri) and crevices (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32260" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">sulci</a>). It is made up of six layers of nerve cells and the nerve pathways that connect them.  The cerebral cortex is responsible for the processes of thought, perception and memory and serves as the seat of advanced motor function, social abilities, language, and problem solving.
