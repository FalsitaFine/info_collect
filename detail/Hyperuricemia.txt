Hyperuricemia: Abnormally 
elevated blood level of uric acid. Uric acid is a breakdown product of purines 
that are part of many foods we eat. While hyperuricemia may indicate an 
increased risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_gouty_arthritis/article.htm">gout</a>      
                
        , the relationship between
hyperuricemia and gout is unclear. Many patients with hyperuricemia do not develop gout,
while some patients with repeated gout attacks have normal or low blood uric acid levels.
Among the male population in the United States, approximately ten percent have
hyperuricemia. However, only a small portion of those with hyperuricemia will actually
develop gout.
