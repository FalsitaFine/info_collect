Dandy fever: An acute mosquito-
borne viral illness of sudden onset that usually follows a 
benign course with headache, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm">fever</a>, prostration, severe 
joint and muscle pain, swollen glands (lymphadenopathy) and 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm"> rash</a>. The presence (the "dengue triad") of fever, rash, and 
headache (and other pains) is particularly characteristic. 
Better known as dengue, the disease is endemic throughout 
the tropics and subtropics. It goes by other names 
including breakbone fever. Victims of dengue often have 
contortions due to the intense joint and muscle pain. 
Hence, the name "breakbone fever." Slaves in the West 
Indies who contracted dengue were said to have "dandy 
fever" because of their postures and gait.
