Epilepsy, grand mal: Epilepsy that includes tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures, which are the most obvious type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">seizure</a>. There are two parts to a tonic-clonic seizure. In the tonic phase, the body becomes rigid, and in the clonic phase, there is uncontrolled jerking. A tonic-clonic seizure may or may not be preceded by an aura, and these seizures are often followed by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">headache</a>, confusion, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a>. They may last for mere seconds or continue for several minutes. If a tonic-clonic seizure does not resolve or if such seizures follow each other in rapid succession, emergency help is needed because the patient could be in a life-threatening state known as status epilepticus. Treatment is with antiseizure medications.
