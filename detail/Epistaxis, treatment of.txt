Epistaxis, treatment of: To stop epistaxis (a
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nosebleed/article.htm"> nosebleed</a>), you should: 1. Pinch all the soft parts of the nose together between your
thumb and index finger. 2. Press firmly toward the face - compressing the pinched parts of
the nose against the bones of the face. 3. Hold the nose for at least 5 minutes (timed by
the clock). Repeat as necessary until the nose has stopped bleeding. 4. Sit quietly,
keeping the head higher than the level of the heart; that is, sit up or lie with the head
elevated. Do not lay flat or put your head between your legs. 5. Apply ice (crushed in a
plastic bag or washcloth) to nose and cheeks.
