<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm">Glaucoma</a>, angle-closure: Increased pressure in 
the front chamber (anterior
chamber) of the eye due to sudden (acute) or slowly 
progressive (chronic)
blockage of the normal circulation of fluid within the eye. 
The block takes
place at the angle of the anterior chamber formed by its 
junction of the
cornea with the iris. This angle can be seen by simply 
looking at someone's
eye from the side. Angle-closure <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm">glaucoma</a> tends to affect 
people born with a
narrow angle. People of Asian and Eskimo ancestry are at 
higher risk of
developing it. Age and family history are risk factors. It 
occurs in older
women more often than others.
