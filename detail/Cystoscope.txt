Cystoscope: An optical instrument (a scope) that is 
inserted through the urethra into the bladder. 
A cystoscope has two ports. Aside from the optical port that 
permits one to see inside the bladder, there is an additional port in 
the instrument for insertion of various instruments designed for 
biopsy (removal of tissue samples), treatment of small bladder 
tumors, removal of stones from the bladder, and removal of the 
prostate (prostatectomy).
