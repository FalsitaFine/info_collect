Brissaud's infantilism: An eponym that is little used (in the USA) for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypothyroidism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hypothyroidism</a> (subnormal activity of the thyroid gland) that starts after birth and is manifest by features including delays in growth and development and myxedema surfacing during infancy. Myxedema is a dry waxy type of swelling, often with swollen lips and nose. Infantile hypothyroidism is synonymous with infantile myxedema. Named for the French physician Edouard Brissaud (1852-1909).
