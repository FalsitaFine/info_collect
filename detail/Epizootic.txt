Epizootic: An epidemic outbreak of disease in an animal population, often with the implication that it may extend to humans.  For example, Rift <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/valley_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Valley fever</a> (RVF) primarily affects livestock and can cause disease in a large number of domestic animals -- an "epizootic" -- and the presence of an RVF epizootic can lead to an epidemic among humans who are exposed to diseased animals. The word "epizootic" is pronounced ep'i-zo-ot'ik. It has Greek roots: epi- meaning "on" among other things, + zoon, "animal."
