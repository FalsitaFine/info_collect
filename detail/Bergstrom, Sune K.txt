Bergstrom, Sune K: (1916-2004)  Swedish physician and scientist who was awarded the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine in 1982 for isolating and elucidating the chemical structure of prostaglandins. The main breakthrough in prostaglandin research was made in the 1950s when Bergström and his associates succeeded in the purification of two important prostaglandins, PGE and PGF, and in identifying their chemical structure. They found that the prostaglandins are formed by conversion of unsaturated fatty acids. Bergström shared the Nobel Prize with his student Bengt Samuelsson and John Vane for their discoveries concerning "prostaglandins and related biologically active substances."
