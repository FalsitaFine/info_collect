A joint is usually formed of fibrous <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2824" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">connective tissue</a> and cartilage. Joints are grouped according to their type of motion: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8748" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">ball-and-socket joint</a>; hinge joint; condyloid joint, which permits all forms of angular movement except axial rotation; pivot joint; gliding joint; or saddle joint. Joints can move in only four ways: gliding, in which one bony surface glides on another, without angular or rotatory movement; angular, a movement that occurs only between long bones, increasing or decreasing the angle between the bones; circumduction, which occurs in joints composed of the head of a bone and an articular cavity, with the long bone describing a series of circles and the whole forming a cone; and rotation, in which a bone moves about a central axis without moving from this axis. Also known as articulation and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8747" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">arthrosis</a>.
