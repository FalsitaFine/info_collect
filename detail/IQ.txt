IQ: Abbreviation for intelligence quotient, an attempt to measure the intelligence of someone. 
The IQ score is usually based upon the results of a written test. To calculate the IQ, the person's mental age (as determined by a test) is divided by their chronologic age and the result is multiplied by 100.
