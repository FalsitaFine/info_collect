Homeotherm: A homeotherm is a warm-blooded
animal (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=40191" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">homo sapiens</a>). Another term for us warm-blooded creatures is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9613" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">endotherm</a>.
Those of us who are homeotherms or endotherms are as opposed to a poikilotherm (an organism such as a frog that is cold-blooded) and a stenotherm (a creature that can only survive only within a very narrow temperature range).  Homeotherm is all Greek. The "homeo-" comes from the Greek "homo" meaning "the same" + "-therm" comes from the Greek "therme" meaning "heat" = the same heat.
