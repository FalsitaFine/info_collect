Allergic reaction:  The hypersensitive response of 
the immune system of an allergic individual to a substance.  When 
an allergen enters the body, it causes the body's immune system to 
develop an allergic reaction in a person with an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm">allergy</a> to it. This 
reaction can occur when the immune system attacks a normally harmless 
substance (the allergen). The immune system calls upon a protective 
antibody called immunoglobulin E or IgE to fight these invading 
substances.  Even though everyone has some IgE, an allergic person 
has an unusually large army of these IgE defenders -in fact, too many 
for their own good. This army of IgE antibodies attacks and engages 
the invading army of allergic substances of allergens. As is often 
the case in war, innocent bystanders are affected by this battle. 
These innocent bystanders are special cells called mast cells. When a 
mast cell is injured or irritated, it releases a variety of strong 
chemicals, including histamine, into the tissues and blood that 
promote allergic reactions. These chemicals are very irritating and 
cause itching, swelling, and fluid leaking from nearby cells. These 
allergic chemicals can cause muscle spasm and can lead to lung airway 
and throat tightening as is found in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm">asthma</a> and loss of voice. They 
are also what leads to the familiar hay fever or allergic rhinitis and
