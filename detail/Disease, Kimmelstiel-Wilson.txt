Disease, Kimmelstiel-Wilson: Diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease).
Kimmelstiel-Wilson disease is a kidney condition associated with
long-standing
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt"> diabetes</a>. It affects the network of tiny blood vessels (the
microvasculature)
in the glomerulus, a key structure in the kidney that is composed of
capillary
blood vessels and which is critically necessary for the filtration of the
blood. Features of Kimmelstiel-Wilson disease include the nephrotic
syndrome
with excessive filtration of protein into the urine (proteinuria), high
blood
pressure (hypertension), and progressively impaired kidney function.  When
severe, Kimmelstiel-Wilson disease leads to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">kidney failure</a>, end-stage renal
disease, and the need for chronic kidney <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dialysis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">dialysis</a> or a kidney transplant.
The
disorder is named for Paul Kimmelstein (1900-70), a German-
born pathologist
in
the U.S., and Clifford Wilson (1906-), an English physician. It is also
known
as intercapillary glomerulonephritis.
