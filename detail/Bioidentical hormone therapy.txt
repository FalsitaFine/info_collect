Bioidentical hormone therapy: Treatment with hormone medications that contain hormones that have the same chemical formula as those made naturally in the body, referred to by many as "bioidentical" hormones.

There has been increasing interest in recent years in the use of this type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hormone_therapy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">hormone therapy</a> for perimenopausal women instead of conventional hormone therapy with synthetic hormones. Some bioidentical hormone preparations are U.S. FDA-approved and manufactured by drug companies, while others are made at special pharmacies called compounding pharmacies, which make the preparations on a case-by-case basis for each patient. These individual preparations are not regulated by the FDA, because compounded products are not standardized.
