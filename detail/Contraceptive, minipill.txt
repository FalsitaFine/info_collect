Contraceptive, minipill: A form of oral contraceptive taken daily, like combined oral contraceptives (the "pill"), but containing only the hormone progestin and no estrogen. The minipill works by reducing and thickening cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the egg. It also keeps the uterine lining from thickening, which prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. The minipill is slightly less effective in preventing conception than the pill.
