Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: a rare genetic condition that results in neurologic and behavioral abnormalities. It occurs almost exclusively in males because it is <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a> in an X-linked recessive manner. This means that the defective gene resides on the X chromosome. Rarely, females are affected because they have two X chromosomes, while males have one, and both copies of the defective gene (one on each X chromosome) would need to be present for a female to be affected. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is associated with elevated levels of a chemical known as uric acid, which can cause <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_gouty_arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">gouty arthritis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_stones/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">kidney stones</a>. The condition is caused by mutations in a gene known as HPRT1.
