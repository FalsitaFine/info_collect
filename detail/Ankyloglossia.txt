Ankyloglossia: A minor birth defect in which the flap of membrane attached to the underside of the tongue (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3519" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">frenulum</a>) is too short. This shortened frenulum limits the mobility of the tongue. Ankyloglossia is also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18465" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">tongue tie</a>, from the folk belief that the anomaly causes feeding and speech problems. A child cannot feed or speak properly because the tongue is 'tied.' This antiquated belief is untrue.
