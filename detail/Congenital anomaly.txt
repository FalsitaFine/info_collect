A <u><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=12759" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">minor anomaly</a></u> is defined as an unusual anatomic feature that is of no serious medical or cosmetic consequence to the patient. A minor anomaly of the feet might, for example, be curvature of the second toe so it overlaps the third toe a little.

The word "congenital" means "at birth." "Anomaly" comes from the Greek word "anomalos" meaning "uneven" or "irregular."
