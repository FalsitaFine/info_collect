Genes: The basic biological units of heredity. Segments of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2945" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">deoxyribonucleic acid</a> (DNA) needed to contribute to a function.
<u>An official definition:</u> According to the official Guidelines for Human Gene Nomenclature, a gene is defined as "a DNA segment that contributes to phenotype/function. In the absence of demonstrated function a gene may be characterized by sequence, transcription or homology." <u>DNA:</u> Genes are composed of DNA, a molecule in the memorable shape of a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3109" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">double helix</a>, a spiral ladder. Each rung of the spiral ladder consists of two paired chemicals called bases. There are four types of bases. They are <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2143" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">adenine</a> (A), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5774" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">thymine</a> (T), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2908" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cytosine</a> (C), and guanine (G). As indicated, each base is symbolized by the first letter of its name: A, T, C, and G. Certain bases always pair together (AT and GC). Different sequences of base pairs form coded messages. 
<u>The gene:</u> A gene is a sequence (a string) of bases. It is made up of combinations of A, T, C, and G. These unique combinations determine the gene's function, much as letters join together to form words. Each person has thousands of genes -- billions of base pairs of DNA or bits of information repeated in the nuclei of human cells --which determine individual  chacteristics (genetic traits).
