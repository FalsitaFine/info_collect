Fear of birds: An abnormal and persistent fear of birds. Sufferers of this fear experience undue <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a> about encountering and even being attacked by birds although they may realize their fears are quite irrational. Fear of birds was epitomized in a 1963 film scripted by the novelist Daphne Du Maurier and the writer Evan Hunter (aka Ed McBain) and directed by the inimicable Alfred Hitchcock -- <i>The Birds</i>. Birds suddenly start attacking people in ever-greater numbers and ever-greater viciousness in this memorable and very frightening movie. Fear of birds is termed "ornithophobia," a word derived from the Greek and "ornithos" (bird) and "phobos" (fear).
