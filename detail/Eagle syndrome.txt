Eagle syndrome: Inflammation of the styloid process, a spike-like growth that projects out of the base of the skull. If the styloid process is oversized or projects too far, the tissues in the throat can rub on it causing pain during the act of swallowing and pain on rotation of the neck. Diagnosis of Eagle syndrome is made by an X-ray demonstrating an abnormally elongated styloid process.
