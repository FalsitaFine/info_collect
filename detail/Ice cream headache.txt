The pain rarely lasts for more a few minutes, if that long.
No treatment is required for an ice cream headache and it is not necessary to stop eating ice cream. The headache can be "headed off" by keeping cold foods and icy beverages away from the back of the palate (the roof of the mouth). The pain of an ice cream headache is a form of referred pain. It is referred from palate where it is triggered to the head and sometimes the teeth.  An ice cream headache is also called a brain freeze.
