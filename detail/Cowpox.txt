Cowpox: A mild skin disease of milk cows, principally confined to the udder and teats, that can be contracted by people from milking an infected cow. Affected people develop vesicles (blebs), which break and form ulcers on the fingers (sometimes called 'milkers' nodules'). These usually heal without scarring.
