Hemangioma, capillary:  A type of hemangioma (a benign tumor formed by a collection of excess blood vessels) that is composed almost entirely of tiny capillary vessels. 
Capillary hemangiomas may be located anywhere on the body but they are most common on the face, scalp, back, and chest. They may be evident at birth or become noticeable several weeks later. They usually grow quickly, then remain fixed in size and, with time, subside. The vast majority are gone by age 10. No treatment is needed. 

Capillary hemangiomas go by a number of different names including strawberry hemangiomas (or strawberry marks) and salmon patches.
