The scientific name for giant hogweed is <i>Heracleum mantegazzianum</i>. Other names for this plant have included cartwheel-flower, giant cow parsnip, hogsbane, or giant cow parsley. Giant hogweed can grow tall, reaching up to 14 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">feet</a> in height after a few years. After 3-5 years of growth, the plant produces large white flowers one to two feet across, as well as five-foot-wide jagged and lobed leaves. Chemicals in the sap known as furanocoumarins cause the severe burns when exposed to UV light from the sun, a process known as phototoxicity.

Giant hogweed was introduced to the US in the early 20th century.
