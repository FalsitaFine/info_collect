Meningitis, neoplastic: A condition due to cancer that has spread from the original (primary) tumor to the meninges, the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord. 
The term is a misnomer because the condition is not inflammatory. It is more properly called meningeal carcinoma or meningeal metastases.
