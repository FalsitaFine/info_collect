Acentric chromosome: A fragment of a 
chromosome (one of the microscopically visible carriers of the 
genetic material DNA) that is lacking a centromere (the "waist" of 
the chromosome essential for the division and the retention of the 
chromosome in the cell) and so is lost when the cell divides.
