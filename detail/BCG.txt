BCG is a weakened (attenuated) version of a bacteria called Mycobacterium bovis which is closely related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent responsible for tuberculosis.

Within a decade the BCG vaccine was being given in France and many other countries. By 1928, BCG had been given to 116,000 infants in France alone.
