Ear puncture: Puncture of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33105" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">ear drum</a> may be due to an accident, often due to a Q tip or other object being pushed too far into the ear. Or it may be due to a rapid build up of pressure in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7867" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">middle ear</a>, usually from an infection that quickly creates pus. A surgical incision (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4495" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">myringotomy</a>) can be made in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3177" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">eardrum</a> to suction out fluid or infection.  A PE (pressure equalization) tube is inserted into the ear drum after an incision is made into it.
