Gene, zygotic lethal: A gene that is fatal for the zygote, the cell formed by the union of a sperm and an egg. The zygote would normally develop into an embryo, as instructed by the genetic material within the unified cell. However, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7752" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">zygotic lethal gene</a> kills <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11899" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">prenatal development</a> at its earliest point. A zygotic lethal gene is a mutated version of a normal gene that is essential to the survival of the zygote.
