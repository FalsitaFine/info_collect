Birthmark: A persistent visible mark on the skin that is evident at birth or shortly thereafter. A birthmark is often due to a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4563">nevus</a> (a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/moles/article.htm">mole</a>) or an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3677">hemangioma</a> (a localized collection of small blood vessels).
Birthmarks that are pink or red are commonly capillary hemangiomas --  collections of tiny blood vessels -- that are most evident when the baby cries. Common locations are on the midforehead, the eyelids, just above the nose, between the nose and the upper lip, and the so-called "stork bite" on the nape of the neck.  These marks generally become harder to see or disappear entirely within a few years.
