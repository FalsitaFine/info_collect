Chamber, anterior: The space in the eye that is behind the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7248" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cornea</a> and in front of the iris. The cornea is the outer, transparent, dome-like structure that covers the iris, pupil, and the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10586" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">anterior chamber</a>. The iris is the colored ring of tissue suspended behind the cornea and immediately in front of the lens; it regulates the amount of light entering the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil.
The anterior chamber is filled with a watery fluid known as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10588" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">aqueous humor</a>, or aqueous. Produced by a structure alongside the lens called the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9891" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">ciliary body</a>, the aqueous passes first into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10640" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">posterior chamber</a> (between the lens and iris) and then flows forward through the pupil into the anterior chamber of the eye.
