Lauterbur, Paul C.: American scientist (1929-) who shared the 2003 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Sir Peter Mansfield for discoveries concerning "magnetic resonance imaging." (Magnetic resonance imaging is better known perhaps as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">MRI</a>). Lauterbur did his work first at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and then at the University of Illinois in Urbana where he is Professor of Chemistry, Biophysics and Computational Biology and Bioengineering.  
Paul Lauterbur discovered the possibility to create a two-dimensional picture by introducing gradients in the magnetic field. By analysis of the characteristics of the emitted radio waves, he could determine their origin. This made it possible to build up two-dimensional pictures of structures that could not be visualized with other methods.
