Kinsey Report: A report entitled "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sexual_sex_problems_in_men/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Sexual</a> Behavior in the Human Male" published by Alfred Charles Kinsey's in 1948 that attracted great attention.
The Kinsey Report, as it was known, was based on extensive interviews with 18,500 subjects. The Report revealed that many practices considered "sexual perversions" were in common usage.  Kinsey (1894-1956), a sociologist, was widely praised and damned for his work. Those who actually read his Report were usually struck by its lack of eroticism and its serious scientific tone.
