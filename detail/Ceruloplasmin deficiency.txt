The absence of ceruloplasmin leads to the abnormal deposition of iron in the pancreas (causing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a>), liver (causing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cirrhosis</a>), retina (damaging vision), and brain (causing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dementia</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/parkinsons_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Parkinson's disease</a>).
