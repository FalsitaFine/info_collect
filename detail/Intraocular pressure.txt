Intraocular pressure: The pressure created by the 
continual renewal of fluids within the eye. The intraocular pressure 
is increased in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm">glaucoma</a>. 
In acute
angle-closure <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm">glaucoma</a>, the intraocular pressure rises because the 
canal into which the
fluid in the front part of the eye normally drains is suddenly 
blocked. 
In chronic
glaucoma, there is a gradual imbalance between the production and 
removal (resorption) of
the fluid in the back part of the eye (with supply exceeding 
demand).
