Duplication: Part of a chromosome in duplicate, a particular kind of mutation (change) involving the production of one or more copies of any piece of DNA, including a gene or even an entire chromosome.

Duplications typically arise from an event termed unequal crossing-over (a kind of recombination) that occurs between misaligned <a href="https://www.medicinenet.comhttps://www.medicinenet.com/high_blood_pressure_hypertension/article.htm0" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">homologous chromosomes</a> during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4335" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">meiosis</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8591" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">germ cell</a> formation). The chance of this event happening is a function of the degree of sharing of repetitive elements between two chromosomes. The recombination products of such an event are a duplication at the site of the exchange and a reciprocal deletion. A remarkable class of duplications in which the duplicated region has popped up far away from home base has also been discovered.
