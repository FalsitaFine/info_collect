Disease, Quincke's: This is angioneurotic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">edema</a> (or angioedema), a form of localized swelling of the deeper layers of the skin and fatty
tissues beneath the skin. Hereditary angioneurotic edema (or hereditary angioedema) is a
genetic form of angioedema. Persons with it are born lacking an inhibitor protein (called
C1 esterase inhibitor) that normally prevents activation of a cascade of proteins leading
to the swelling of angioedema. Patients can develop recurrent attacks of swollen tissues,
pain in the abdomen, and swelling of the voice box (larynx) which can compromise
breathing. The diagnosis is suspected with a history of recurrent angioedema. It is
confirmed by finding abnormally low levels of C1 esterase inhibitor in the blood.
Treatment options include antihistamines and male steroids (androgens) that can also
prevent the recurrent attacks.
