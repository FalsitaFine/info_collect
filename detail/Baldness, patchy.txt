Baldness, patchy: Patchy baldness. Also referred to as  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alopecia_areata/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">alopecia areata</a>. Alopecia means baldness and areata means occurring in patches. This process typically begins with patchy <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hair loss</a> on the scalp and sometimes progresses to complete baldness and even loss of body hair. The hair loss tends to be rather rapid and asymmetrical and is different than male pattern baldness.
