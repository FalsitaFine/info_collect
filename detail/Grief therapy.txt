Grief therapy: Therapy for 
people who have unusually serious grief reactions. The goal of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/loss_grief_and_bereavement/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">grief therapy</a> is 
to identify and solve problems the mourner may have in separating from the 
person who died. When separation difficulties occur, they may appear as physical 
or behavior problems, delayed or extreme mourning, conflicted or extended grief, 
or unexpected mourning (although this is seldom present with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> deaths).
