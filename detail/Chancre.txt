Chancre: The classic painless ulcer of syphilis. The
chancre forms in the first (primary) stage of syphilis. It is highly contagious and can last 1-5 weeks. The disease can be transmitted from contact with the ulcer, which is teeming with spirochetes. If the ulcer is outside of the vagina or on the scrotum of
the male, the use of condoms may not help in preventing transmission of the disease. Likewise, if the ulcer is in the mouth, merely kissing the infected individual can spread syphilis. 
The word chancre is the French for a little ulcer. Chancre and the English canker come from the Latin <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm">cancer</a> for crab. Why? Perhaps because chronic ulcers can be hard like the shell of a crab.
