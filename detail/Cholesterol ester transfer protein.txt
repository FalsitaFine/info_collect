Cholesterol ester transfer protein: A protein that helps regulate the size of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cholesterol_management/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cholesterol</a> particles and influence the process of atherogenesis (the formation of plaques in arteries). Abbreviated CETP. The CETP gene is in chromosome band 16q21. A number of mutations are known in the CETP gene. Some result in CEPT deficiency, increased levels of HDL ("good") cholesterol and unusually large cholesterol particles. CETP deficiency appears to be a good mutation which is antiatherogenic and may confer unusual longevity to the person. Also called cholesteryl ester transfer protein.
