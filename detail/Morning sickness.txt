Morning sickness: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. 
Morning sickness is a misnomer, because it can occur at any time of the day (though not at night during <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm">sleep</a>) and it is not a sickness. It is a normal characteristic of early pregnancy.
