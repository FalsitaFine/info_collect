Heterochromatin, constitutive: Heterochromatin that is
fixed and irreversible. Regions of constitutive heterochromatin are located at very specific spots in the genome (on chromosomes 1, 9, 16 and the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6049" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Y chromosome</a>, the tiny short arms of chromosomes 13-15 and 21 and 22, and near the centromeres of chromosomes) and
consists of DNA that contains many tandem (not inverted) repeats of a short basic repeating unit (known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5411" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">satellite DNA</a>).
