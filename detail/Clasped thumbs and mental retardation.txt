Clasped thumbs and mental retardation: A syndrome with the following
characteristic features: (1) neurologically: mental retardation and aphasia (lack of
speech); (2) limbs: adducted (clasped) thumbs, absent extensor pollicis longus and/or
brevis muscles to the thumb, shuffling gait, and leg spasticity; (3) growth: small body
size; (4) skeleton: lumbar lordosis (sway back). The syndrome is inherited as an X-linked
trait and so affects mainly boys. Alternative names include MASA syndrome (MASA stands for
mental retardation, aphasia, shuffling gait, and adducted thumbs), adducted thumb with
mental retardation, congenital clasped thumb with mental retardation, and the Gareis-Mason
syndrome.
