Mycobacterium chelonae: A type of bacteria related to that which causes chronic illness and which is commonly found in soil and sometimes in sputum. M. chelonae is one of a group of rapidly growing mycobacteria that can cause postoperative wound infections in soft tissue and bone in otherwise healthy persons and disseminated disease in people with impaired immune function.
