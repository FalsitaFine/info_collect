Herbal remedy: A medication prepared from plants, 
including most of the world's traditional remedies for 
disease. Most people think of herbal remedies as products 
sold over the counter as "supplements", such as saw 
palmetto extract or goldenseal ointment. However, many over-

originally derived from plants, including aspirin and

drugs as carefully as prescription medicines, taking care 
to avoid overdose, interactions with other medications, and 
misuse.
