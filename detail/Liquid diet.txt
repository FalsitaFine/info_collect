Liquid diet: The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/liquid_diet/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">Liquid diet</a> is the restriction of solid food intake, and replacement of solid food with liquids. In hospitals, liquid diets are prescribed by doctors for a number of reasons for patients who are unable to consume solid foods. Liquid diets may be prescribed following surgery or as a preparation for certain medical procedures. Additionally, some people have injuries or medical conditions that limit their ability to eat solid foods. Most prescribed liquid diets allow sports drinks, broth, tea, and coffee. Strained juices may also be permitted.
