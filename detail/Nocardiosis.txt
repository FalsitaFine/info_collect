Nocardiosis: Infection with Nocardia, filamentous bacteria found in soil worldwide. Infection tends to strike the lungs, brain, and skin, particularly in people with an impaired <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3907" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">immune system</a>. The inhalation of Nocardia spores usually initiates nocardiosis in the lung. The skin form of nocardiosis is contracted through soil contamination of wounds. There is no evidence for person-to-<br/> person transmission of Nocardia. Treatment is long-term antibiotic therapy.
