Aneurysm, racemose: An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/brain_aneurysm/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">aneurysm</a> is a localized widening (dilatation) of an artery, vein, or the heart.  At the area of an aneurysm, there is typically a bulge and the wall is weakened and may rupture. The word "aneurysm" comes from the Greek "aneurysma" meaning "a widening." A racemose aneurysm looks like a bunch of grapes. From the Latin "racemus" meaning "a cluster or bunch, particularly of grapes."
