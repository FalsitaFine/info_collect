Claudication, intermittent: Pain in the calf that comes and goes, typically felt while <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">walking</a>, and usually subsiding with rest. Intermittent <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/claudication/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">claudication</a> can be due to temporary artery narrowing due to vasospasm, permanent artery narrowing due to atherosclerosis, or complete occlusion of an artery to the leg. The prognosis is generally favorable because the condition often stabilizes or improves with time. Walking regularly can sometimes increase the distance that the patient can walk without symptoms. Drugs may be prescribed for management. If conservative therapy is inadequate and claudication is severe and persistent, correction of the narrowing in the affected artery with surgery, such as bypass grafting, or interventional radiology, such as balloon angioplasty might be suggested.
