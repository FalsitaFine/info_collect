Chronic pain: Pain (an   unpleasant sense of discomfort) that persists or progresses over a long period   of time. In contrast to acute pain that arises suddenly in response to a   specific injury and is usually treatable, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_pain/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">chronic pain</a> persists over time and is often resistant to medical treatments.
