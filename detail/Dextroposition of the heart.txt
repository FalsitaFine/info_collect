Dextroposition of the heart: The heart is displaced to
the right (from its usual location in the left chest). There is no anatomic alteration in
the heart itself, just in its location. Dextroposition occurs when the contents of the
left side of the chest shove the heart to the right or when the contents of the right
chest are reduced (for example, by collapse of the right lung) and the heart moves toward
the sparsely occupied space on the right.
