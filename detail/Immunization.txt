Immunization: Vaccination. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm">Immunizations</a> work by 
stimulating
the immune system, the natural disease-fighting system of the body. 
The healthy immune
system is able to recognize invading bacteria and viruses and produce 
substances
(antibodies) to destroy or disable them. Immunizations prepare the 
immune system to ward
off a disease. To immunize against viral diseases, the virus used in 
the vaccine has been
weakened or killed. To immunize against bacterial diseases, it is 
generally possible to
use only a small portion of the dead bacteria to stimulate the 
formation of antibodies
against the whole bacteria. In addition to the initial immunization 
process, it has been
found that the effectiveness of immunizations can be improved by 
periodic repeat
injections or "boosters." Also see Immunizations (in the 
plural) and
Immunization of a specific type (such Immunization, Polio).
