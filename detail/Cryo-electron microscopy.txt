Cryo-electron microscopy: An electron microscopic technique that involves freezing the biological sample in order to view the sample with the least possible distortion and the fewest possible artifacts. Abbreviated as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=24624" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cryo-EM</a>.  In cryo-EM, the freezing of the sample is done in ethane slush to produce vitreous, or non-crystalline, ice. The frozen sample grid is then kept at <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32809" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">liquid nitrogen</a> temperature in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3216" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">electron microscope</a> and digital micrographs are collected with a camera. The advantages of cryo-EM over traditional EM techniques include the preservation of the sample in a near-native hydrated state without the distortions from stains or fixatives needed for traditional EM. With image processing and averaging of multiple images, cyro-EM provides high resolution information (below 10 anstroms).
