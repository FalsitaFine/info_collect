Malrotated ear: An ear that is slanted more than usual.
Technically, an ear is slanted when the angle of the slope of the auricle is more than 15
degrees from the perpendicular. Slanted ears are considered a minor anomaly. The presence
of 2 or more minor anomalies in a child increases the probability that the child has a
major malformation.
