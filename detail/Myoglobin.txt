Myoglobin: The pigment in muscle that carries oxygen.
Myoglobin (Mb): a protein found in muscle tissue that is related to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">hemoglobin</a> (the oxygen-carrying component of blood). Like hemoglobin, myoglobin is able to bind and store oxygen molecules. Blood (serum) and urine levels of myoglobin can rise following muscle injury. Elevated blood levels of myoglobin can be seen with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attacks</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures_symptoms_and_types/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">seizures</a>, muscle diseases like muscular dystrophy, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/trauma_and_first_aid_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">trauma</a>, surgery, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/polymyositis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">myositis</a> (inflammation of the muscles). Normal blood levels may vary according to the laboratory performing the test, but in general, normal myoglobin levels in the blood are between 25 to 72 ng/mL (1.28 to 3.67 nmol/L).
