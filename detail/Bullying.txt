Bullying: physical or verbal aggression that is repeated over a period, and involves an imbalance of power. While <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/bullying/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">bullying</a> often is associated with children and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teenagers/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">teens</a>, bullying can occur in any age group. Four types of bullying have been described, and include, physical, verbal, relational, and reactive. The imbalance of power associated with bullying is evidenced by the bully using the higher social status they have over the victim to exert power, and to hurt the victim. Forms of bullying can include harassment, name-calling, gossiping, rumor spreading, threats, or other forms of intimidation. These may be done in person or expand to involve the use of emails, chat rooms, blogs, or social media, which is referred to as cyber-bullying or online bullying.
