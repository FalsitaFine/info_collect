Granuloma:  A granuloma is one of a number of forms 
of localized nodular inflammation found in tissues. The fact that a 
granuloma is localized is important. So is its nodularity. Granulomas 
have a typical pattern when examined under a microscope. 

Granulomas can be caused by a variety of biologic, chemical and 
physical irritants of tissue.

A calcified granuloma is a granuloma containing calcium deposits. 
Since it usually takes some time for calcium to be deposited in a 
granuloma, it is generally assumed that a calcified granuloma is an 
old granuloma. For example, a calcified 
granuloma in the lung may be due to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tuberculosis_tb_facts/article.htm">tuberculosis</a> contracted years
