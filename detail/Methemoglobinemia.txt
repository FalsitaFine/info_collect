<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="PROC"> hemoglobin</a> that is useless for carrying oxygen and delivering it to tissues 
throughout the human body. A small amount of methemoglobin is normally present 
in blood but the conversion of a larger fraction of hemoglobin into 
methemoglobin, which does not function well as an oxygen carrier, results in clinical symptoms. Since hemoglobin is the key carrier of oxygen in the blood, 
its replacement by methemoglobin can cause a slate gray-blueness of the skin 
(cyanosis), and potentially cause more serious symptoms due to insufficient 
oxygen.
