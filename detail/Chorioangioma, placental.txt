Chorioangioma, placental: A benign <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> of a blood vessel in the placenta. Large chorioangiomas can cause complications, including excess amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios), maternal and fetal clotting problems (coagulopathies), premature delivery, toxemia, fetal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_failure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart failure</a>, and hydrops (excess fluid) affecting the fetus. Chorioangiomas probably act as shunts between arteries and veins (arteriovenous shunts), leading to progressive heart failure of the fetus.
