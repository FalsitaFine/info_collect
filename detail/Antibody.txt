The production of antibodies is a major function of the immune system and is carried out by a type of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6017">white blood cell</a> called a B cell (B <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4220">lymphocyte</a>). Antibodies can be triggered by and directed at foreign proteins, microorganisms, or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5828">toxins</a>.
