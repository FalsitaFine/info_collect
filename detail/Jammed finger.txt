Jammed finger: Lay terminology that refers to an injury of the finger joints. The most common joint affected is the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP), the joint formed by the first and second finger bones. A jammed finger occurs because of an on-end injury to the tip of a finger. The injury most commonly occurs during athletic activity, particularly with ball-handling sports.
