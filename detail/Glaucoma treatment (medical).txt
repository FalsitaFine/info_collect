Glaucoma treatment (medical): Although <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/glaucoma/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">glaucoma</a> cannot
be cured, it can usually be controlled. Medical treatment can be in the form of eyedrops
or pills. Some drugs are designed to reduce pressure by slowing the flow of fluid into the
eye, while others help to improve fluid drainage. The regular use of medications usually
controls the increased fluid pressure. However, these drugs may stop working over time or
they may cause side effects so that the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_care/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">eye care</a> professional may select other drugs,
change the dose, or use other means to deal with the glaucoma.
