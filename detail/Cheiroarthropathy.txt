Cheiroarthropathy: A syndrome of limited joint mobility that occurs in patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a>. Cheiroarthropathy is characterized by thickening of the skin resulting in contracture of the fingers. Cheiroarthropathy causes such limited motion of the fingers that the affected individual is unable to extend the fingers to fully flatten the hand. Typically both hands are affected by cheiroarthropathy. Cheiroarthropathy has been reported in over half of patients with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/insulin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">insulin</a>-dependent diabetes and approximately three quarters of those with noninsulin-dependent diabetes. Cheiroarthropathy occurs more frequently in those with a longer history of diabetes.Treatment of cheiroarthropathy includes pain reliever and/or antiinflammation medicines, stretching exercises, and tight control of the blood sugar level.
