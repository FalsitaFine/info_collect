Ileitis, terminal: Crohn's disease, a chronic
inflammatory disease of the intestine involving only the end of the 
small intestine (the
terminal ileum). Crohn's disease affects primarily the small and 
large intestines but
which can occur anywhere in the digestive system between the mouth 
and the anus. Named
after Burrill Crohn who described the disease in 1932. The disease 
often strikes persons
in their <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/teenagers/article.htm">teens</a> or early twenties. It tends to be chronic, recurrent 
with periods of
remission and exacerbation. In the early stages, it causes small 
scattered shallow
crater-like areas (erosions) called aphthous ulcers in the inner 
surface of the bowel. With
time, deeper and larger ulcers develop, causing scarring and 
stiffness of the bowel and
the bowel becomes increasingly narrowed, leading to obstruction. Deep 
ulcers can puncture
holes in the bowel wall, leading to infection in the abdominal cavity 
(peritonitis) and in
adjacent organs <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm">Abdominal pain</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm">diarrhea</a>, vomiting, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm">fever</a>, and weight

symptoms. Crohn's disease can be associated with reddish tender 
skin nodules, and
inflammation of the joints, spine, eyes, and liver.
