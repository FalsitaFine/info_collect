Mutation, germline: A   heritable change in the   DNA that occurred in a germ cell (a cell destined to become an   egg or in the   sperm) or the   zygote (the conceptus) at the single-cell stage.  (This is also termed gonadal mosaicism) When transmitted to a child, a germline mutation is incorporated in every cell of their body.
