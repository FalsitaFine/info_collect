(arthralgia), and swelling. Chikungunya fever was first described in epidemic form in East Africa in 1952-1953. The virus is arthropod-borne (it is therefore an arbovirus) and belongs to the family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus. Human infections are acquired by the bite of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, and epidemics are sustained by human-mosquito-human transmission. This epidemic cycle is similar to that of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dengue_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">dengue</a> and urban <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/yellow_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">yellow fever</a>.
