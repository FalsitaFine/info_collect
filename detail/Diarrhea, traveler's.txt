Diarrhea, traveler's: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Diarrhea</a> illness associated with travel to a foreign
country.  Among the causes of traveler's diarrhea are viruses and
enterotoxigenic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/e_coli__0157h7/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">E. coli </a>(ETEC). E.coli is a particular type of bacteria that
normally lives in the intestines of people (and animals). Most strains of E
coli are quite harmless. They are simply part of the normal intestinal
flora. However, there are some kinds of E. coli that are capable of causing
disease.  Not all E. coli bacteria that cause disease are alike. There are
multiple classes of "bad" E.coli. The enterotoxigenic E.coli (ETEC)
constitute a class of "bad" E.coli. They produce toxins (poisons). The ETEC
toxins do not injure or kill the cells lining the intestines. They alter the
metabolism of these cells, disturbing the regulation of fluid and
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc"> electrolytes</a> (like sodium and potassium) absorbed from the intestines.
Instead of absorbing fluid, the intestinal cells permit fluid to be secreted
into the intestine. This causes diarrhea. ETEC causes diarrhea in infants
and traveler's diarrhea. ETEC is a cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/food_poisoning/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">food poisoning</a>. The cornerstone
of ETEC therapy is replacement of fluids and electrolytes (sodium and other
ions) lost in the diarrhea. The ideal approach to ETEC is to avoid exposure
to it.
