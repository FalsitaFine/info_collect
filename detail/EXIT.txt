EXIT: Stands for ex utero intrapartum treatment. Surgery on the fetus may be done after a Cesarean section, but before the cord is cut, so that the fetus is sustained by the mother's placenta and does not have to breath on its own. This method is employed when the fetus suffers from a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2818" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">congenital defect</a> that blocks the airway. By the time the cord is cut and the baby has to breath, he or she has a clear airway.
