Gilbert syndrome: A common but harmless genetic condition in which UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, a liver enzyme that is essential to the disposal of bilirubin, is abnormal. Mutations in the same gene cause the Crigler-Najjar syndrome, which is a more severe and dangerous form of hyperbilirubinemia (high bilirubin in the blood). Also known as hyperbilirubinemia type 1.
