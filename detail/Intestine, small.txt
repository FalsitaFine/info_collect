Intestine, small: The tubelike organ that 
receives the products of digestion from the stomach. It has 
three parts, the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The 
duodenum is rich in glands that produce digestive enzymes, 
and also receives bile from the liver. Digested material 
moves from the duodenum to the ileum through the jejunum. 
The ileum ends with the ileocecal valve, which prevents 
food passed into the large intestine from traveling back 
into the small intestine. The walls of the small intestine 
are muscular, and contract to move digested food along its 
length. The intestinal tube is lined with a mucus-like 
tissue that sends forth tiny, finger-like projections 
called villi. The villi increase the surface available for 
absorbing nutrients from digested food. See also intestine, 
large.
