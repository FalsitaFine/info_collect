Fireworks injury: An injury from a device for producing a striking display by the combustion of explosive or flammable compositions. Since fireworks are often used around holidays, fireworks injuries tend to cluster about holidays and can spoil them. All fireworks are potentially dangerous, especially to children. Children 14 years and younger sustain about 50% of the injuries related to fireworks, and boys represent about 75% of all those injured. Injuries from fireworks most often affect the hands and fingers, eyes, and head and face.  Fireworks injuries involved the hands and fingers (32%), eyes (21%), and head and face (17%) in the US in 2004.
