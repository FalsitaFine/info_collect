Catheter, hemodialysis: A venous catheter used for <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemodialysis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">hemodialysis</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dialysis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">dialysis</a> of the blood). A hemodialysis catheter is a type of central venous catheter. It may be inserted into the subclavian, internal jugular, or femoral veins. Subclavian catheters generally may be used for 2 to 6 weeks. Hemodialysis catheters are often for relatively short-term use because of an acute need for dialysis or because chronic dialysis is just starting.   Long-term access for hemodialysis may be provided by subcutaneous arteriovenous fistulas in which an artery (the radial artery) is surgically anastomosed (connected) to a vein (the cephalic vein). However, after this procedure is done, it takes 6 to 8 weeks for the forearm veins to dilate and arterialize to be suitable for repeated puncture and hence for long-term hemodialysis.
