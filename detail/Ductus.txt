Ductus: A duct or walled passageway suitable for the conveyance of air or, more often in the body, liquids. 
The term "ductus" also refers a key arterial <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5488">shunt</a> (ductus) in fetal 
life. Before birth, blood pumped from the heart through the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=24368">pulmonary artery</a> 
toward the lungs is shunted into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2295">aorta</a>. This arterial 
shunt, a short vessel, is the ductus arteriosus. When the shunt is open, it is 
said to be patent. The ductus arteriosus usually closes at or shortly after 
birth, permitting blood from that moment on to course from the heart directly to 
the lungs. However, if the ductus arteriosus remains open (patent), flow 
reverses and blood from the aorta is shunted into the pulmonary artery and recirculated through the lungs. A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=26031">patent ductus</a> may close later spontaneously (on its own) or need to be ligated (tied off) surgically.
Our word "duct" is a contraction of the Latin word "ductus" meaning
"leading". The Romans, however, preferred the word "canalis" meaning
"a pipe or gutter" for a conduit.
