Some affected people have intellectual disability. The condition has also been referred to as HSS or Hallermann Streiff Francois syndrome. The abnormal facial features can include a short, broad head (brachycephaly), a prominent forehead and/or sides of the skull (frontal bossing); a small lower jaw (micrognathia); a narrow, highly arched palate; and a thin, pinched, tapering nose (beaked nose). The genetic cause of Hallermann-Streiff syndrome is not understood and most cases occur randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically).
