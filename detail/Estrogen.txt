Estrogen: A female steroid hormone that is produced by the ovaries and, in lesser amounts, by the adrenal cortex, placenta, and male testes. Estrogen helps control and guide <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sexual_sex_problems_in_men/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sexual</a> development, including the physical changes associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puberty/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">puberty</a>. It also influences the course of ovulation in the monthly menstrual cycle, lactation after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pregnancy</a>, aspects of mood, and the aging process. Production of estrogen changes naturally over the female lifespan, reaching adult levels with the onset of puberty (menarche) and decreasing in middle age until the onset of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">menopause</a>. Estrogen deficiency can lead to lack of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/menstruation/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">menstruation</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/amenorrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">amenorrhea</a>), persistent difficulties associated with menopause (such as mood swings and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_dryness_and_vaginal_atrophy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">vaginal dryness</a>), and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">osteoporosis</a> in older age. In cases of estrogen deficiency, natural and synthetic estrogen preparations may be prescribed. Estrogen is also a component of many oral contraceptives. An overabundance of estrogen in men causes development of female secondary sexual characteristics (feminization), such as enlargement of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breast</a> tissue.
