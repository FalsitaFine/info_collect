Developmental disorder: One of several disorders 
that interrupt normal development in childhood. They may 
affect a single area of development (specific developmental 
disorders) or several (pervasive developmental disorders). 
With early intervention, most specific developmental 
disorders can be accommodated and overcome. Early 
intervention is absolutely essential for pervasive 
developmental disorders, many of which will respond to an 
aggressive approach that may combine speech therapy, 
occupational therapy, physical therapy, behavior 
modification techniques, play therapy, and in some cases 
medication. See also <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/autism_and_communication/article.htm">autism</a>, developmental dyspraxia,
