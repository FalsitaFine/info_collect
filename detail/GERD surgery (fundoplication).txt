GERD surgery (fundoplication): A surgical technique that strengthens the barrier to acid reflux when the lower esophageal sphincter does not work normally and there is gastro-esophageal reflux.
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fundoplication/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">Fundoplication</a> has been the standard surgical method for treating gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is the constellation of inflammation, pain (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heartburn_reflux/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heartburn</a>), and complications that results when acid refluxes (regurgitates) from the stomach back up into the esophagus.  Under normal conditions, there is a barrier to acid reflux.  One part of this barrier is the lower-most muscle of the esophagus (called the lower esophageal sphincter) which is contracted and closes off the esophagus from the stomach most of the time.  In people with GERD, the sphincter does not work normally.  It is weak or relaxes inappropriately, permitting the acid from the stomach to go back up into the esophagus.
