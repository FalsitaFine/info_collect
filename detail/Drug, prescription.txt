Drug, prescription: A drug 
requiring a prescription, as opposed to an over-the-counter drug, which can be 
purchased without one. The word "prescription" comes from the Latin 
"praescriptus" compounded from "prae", before + scribere, to write =      
          
      
  
      
   
to write before. Historically, a prescription was written before the 
drug was prepared and
administered.
