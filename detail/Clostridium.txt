Clostridium: A group of anaerobic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=13954">bacteria</a> (bacteria that thrive in the absence of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10690">oxygen</a>). There are 100+ species of Clostridium. They include, for examples,  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2760">Clostridium difficile</a>, Clostridium perfringens (also called Clostridium welchii), and Clostridium botulinum.
<u>Clostridium difficile</u> is one
of the most common causes of infection of the large bowel (the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2787">colon</a>) in the US affecting millions of people yearly. Patients taking antibiotics are at risk of becoming infected with C. difficile. Antibiotics disrupt the normal bacteria of the bowel, allowing C.
difficile bacteria to become established in the colon. Many persons infected with C.difficile have no symptoms. These people become carriers of the bacteria and can infect others. In other people, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5828">toxin</a> produced by C. difficile causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2985">diarrhea</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm">abdominal pain</a>, severe <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3979">inflammation</a> of the colon (colitis), <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3425">fever</a>, an elevated white blood
count, vomiting and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2933">dehydration</a>. In severely affected patients, the inner lining of the colon becomes severely inflamed (a condition called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5099">pseudomembranous colitis</a>). Rarely, the walls of the colon wear away and holes develop (colon perforation), which can lead to a life-threatening infection of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2081">abdomen</a>.
<u>Clostridium perfringens</u>, also known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6541">Clostridium welchii</a>), this is the most common agent of gas <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gangrene/article.htm">gangrene</a> and also causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=16212">food poisoning</a> as well as a fulminant form of bowel disease called necrotizing colitis.
<u>Clostridium botulinum</u> is the culprit responsible for the food poisoning and other problems associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11052">botulism</a>.
