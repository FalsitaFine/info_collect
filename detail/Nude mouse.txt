Nude mouse: A mutant mouse said to be nude because it is hairless due to the presence two copies of the gene "nu" (for nude). Nude mice have no thymus and therefore no T cells, a class of lymphocytes that depend on the thymus to develop. For lack of T cells, nude mice cannot reject tumors or transplants of cells from humans or other animals. Nude mice have served in the laboratory to gain insights into the immune system, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leukemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">leukemia</a>, solid tumors, AIDS and other forms of immune deficiency. Nude mice were discovered and first bred by Miroslav Holub (1923-1998), a distinguished Czech immunologist and a renowned poet.
