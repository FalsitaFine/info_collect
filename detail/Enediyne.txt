Enediyne: A very potent and naturally occurring antibiotic that acts by cleaving DNA. The adverse effects of enediynes on cells include mutagenicity (increase mutation), halting mitois (cell division) by arresting the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7107" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cell cycle</a>, and inducing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11287" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">apoptosis</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11288" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">programmed cell death</a>). Enediynes were first isolated in the 1960s by the fermentation of microbes.
