Leon virus: Type 3 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=40557" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">poliovirus</a>. Named after the patient in California from whom this virus was first isolated. There are two other strains of poliovirus: Type 1 (known as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=40554" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Brunhilde virus</a>) and Type 2 (known as the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=40555" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Lansing virus</a>). Immunity to one strain does not provide protection against the other two. All three strains are therefore included in the poliovirus vaccine.
