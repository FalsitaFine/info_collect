Directives, advance: Known also as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/advance_medical_directives/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">advance medical directives</a>, these are documents that pertain to treatment preferences and the designation of a surrogate decision-maker in the event that a person should become unable to make medical decisions on their own behalf. Advance directives generally fall into three categories: living will, power of attorney and health care proxy.
