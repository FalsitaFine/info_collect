Myopia: Nearsightedness, the ability to see close 
objects more clearly than distant objects.
Myopia can be caused by a longer-than-normal eyeball or by any 
condition that prevents light rays from focusing on the retina. 
Most forms of myopia can be managed with corrective lenses. 
Surgery is available to permanently correct some forms of myopia, 
although long-term effectiveness and safety has not been fully 
determined.
