b.i.d. (on prescription): Seen on a prescription, b.i.d. means 
twice (two times) a day. It is
an abbreviation for "bis in die" which in Latin means twice 
a day. The
abbreviation b.i.d. is sometimes written without a period 
either in
lower-case letters as "bid" or in capital letters as 
"BID".  However it is
written, it is one of a number of hallowed abbreviations of 
Latin terms that
have been traditionally used in prescriptions to specify 
the frequency with
which medicines should be taken.
