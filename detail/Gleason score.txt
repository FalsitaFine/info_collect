Gleason score: A grading system for prostate carcinoma devised by Dr. Donald Gleason in 1977 as a method for predicting the behavior of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prostate_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">prostate cancer</a>. Tumors with a low Gleason score are less likely to show aggressive behavior and therefore are less likely to have  spread outside of the gland to lymph nodes (metastases). Gleason's original data showed a progressive increase in death due to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> with an increasing Gleason score. Gleason described five distinct patterns of prostate cancer growth which were based on the pattern that the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> glands made (as viewed through the microscope on stained tissue sections). These are commonly referred to now as Gleason patterns 1 through  5, with pattern 1 being the most well differentiated and therefore  the most favorable. Most, if not all tumors, have a mixture of  patterns. To obtain a Gleason score or grade, the  dominant pattern is added to the second most prevalent pattern  to obtain a number between 2 and 10. If a tumor has patterns 3 and 2, the score would be 5. If the tumor has only one pattern, or less than 5% of a secondary pattern, then the single pattern  is added to itself (e.g. 3+3=6).
The Gleason grading system is not the only grading scheme in existence,  but at present it is the most popular one in the United States. The importance  of any grading system is that it allows patients with tumors of  similar biologic behavior to be compared in studies and provides some useful information for patient treatment options.
The Gleason score is one of several factors in the decision making process with prostate cancer.
