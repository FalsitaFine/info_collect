Iodine deficiency: A lack of sufficient iodine in the diet, which can lead to inadequate production of thyroid hormone (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hypothyroidism/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hypothyroidism</a>) and enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter). Since the addition of iodine to table salt became common, iodine deficiency has rarely been seen in the US.
