GJB2: A gene that provides instructions to make a protein called gap junction beta 2. Mutations in the GJB2 gene are responsible for autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of nonsyndromic deafness (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hearing loss</a> without related signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body) as well as some other genetic disorders. The GJB2 gene is a member of the gap junction or connexin family. This family of genes produces protein subunits for channels (gap junctions) that connect neighboring cells. The channels (which are made from several protein subunits) permit the movement of nutrients, charged atoms (ions), and communication signals between cells. The size of the channel opening and the specific particles that move through the channel are determined by the protein subunits that make up the channel. For example, channels made with gap junction beta 2 protein permit the movement of potassium ions, along with other molecules.
