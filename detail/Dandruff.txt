Dandruff: A scalp condition that produces white flakes that may be shed and fall from the hair. One cause of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seborrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">dandruff</a> is overworking of the sebaceous glands. Another cause of dandruff is fungus, especially an abundance of the fungus Pitrosporum ovale. If several weeks of using a good-quality shampoo does not stop the dandruff, treatment options include an antifungal shampoo such as Denorex, DHS Targel, ionil-T plus, MG217, Neutrogena T/Gel, Scalpicin, Sebulex, Selsun Blue, Tegrin, or Zircon. The active ingredients approved for dandruff treatment by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include tar, pyrithione zinc, salicylic acid, selenium sulfide, sulfur, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ketoconazole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">ketoconazole</a>.
