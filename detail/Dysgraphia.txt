Dysgraphia: A specific developmental disability that affects a person's handwriting ability. Problems may include fine-motor-muscle control of the hands and/or processing difficulties. Sometimes occupational 'therapy is helpful for those with dysgraphia. Most successful students with dysgraphia that does not respond to occupational therapy or extra writing help use a typewriter, computer, or verbal communication.
