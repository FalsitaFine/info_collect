It can also develop from the undesirability of a partner, the undesirability of a setting, and the use of alcohol or drugs. Alternate names for this disorder are anorgasmia and anorgasmy.

"Orgasm-" is derived from the Greek "orgasmos" (swell) and "orgein" (to be lustful). "The suffix "-ic" is derived from the Greek "ikos," meaning "having to do with." "Dys-" is derived from a Greek prefix of the same spelling. It means "ill" or "bad."
