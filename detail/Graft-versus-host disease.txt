Graft-versus-host disease: A complication of bone marrow transplants in which T cells in the donor bone marrow graft go on the offensive and attack the host's tissues. <a href="/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=201287" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)</a> is seen most often in cases where the blood marrow donor is unrelated to the patient or when the donor is related to the patient, but not a perfect match. There are two forms of GVHD: an early form called acute GVHD that occurs soon after the transplant when the white cells are on the rise, and a late form called chronic GVHD.
