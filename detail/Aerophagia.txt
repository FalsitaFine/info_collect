Aerophagia: Swallowing too much air, a common cause of
gas in the stomach and belching. Everyone swallows small amounts of air when eating or drinking. However, rapid eating or drinking, chewing gum,    smoking, or ill-fitting dentures may cause
a significant increase in swallowed air.
The word "phage" in Greek means
"to eat." Aerophagia is literally to eat air.
