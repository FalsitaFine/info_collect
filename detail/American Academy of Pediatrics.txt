American Academy of Pediatrics: AAP. Its member pediatricians "dedicate their efforts and resources to
the health, safety and well-being of infants, children, adolescents and
young adults." According to the Academy, it had as of 1998 some 53,000
members in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Over 34,000 of them
were board-certified and called Fellows of the American Academy of
Pediatrics (FAAP). 
The American Academy of Pediatrics was founded in June,
1930 by 35 pediatricians who met in Detroit in response to the need for an
independent pediatric forum to address children's needs. When the Academy
was established, the idea that children have special developmental and
health needs was a new one. Preventive health practices now associated with
child care - such as immunizations and regular health exams - were only just
beginning to change the custom of treating children as "miniature adults."

The activities of the Academy now include advocacy for children and youth;
public education; research; professional education; membership service and
advocacy for pediatricians. One of the Academy's major activities also is to
further the professional education of its members; continuing education
courses, biannual scientific meetings, seminars, publications and statements
from committees and sections form the basis of a continuing postgraduate
educational program. More than 30 committees develop many of the Academy's
positions and programs. Committees have interests as varied as injury and
poison <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">prevention</a>, disabled children, sports medicine, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nutrition/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">nutrition</a> and child
health financing. The Academy publishes the scientific journal called
Pediatrics monthly; Pediatrics in Review, its continuing education journal;
and the monthly membership newspaper AAP News.  It also periodically
publishes manuals on such topics as infectious diseases and school health.
In its public education efforts, the AAP produces patient education
brochures, Healthy Kids magazine, and a series of child care books written
by AAP members. Each year the Academy designates October as Child Health
Month to emphasize the importance of preventive health care and other child
health issues. The Academy executes original research in social, economic
and behavioral areas and promotes funding of research. It maintains a
Washington Office to ensure that <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/childrens_health/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">children's health</a> needs are taken into
consideration as legislation and public policy are developed. The AAP's
state advocacy staff provides assistance to chapters, promoting issues such
as child safety legislation and Medicaid policies that increase access to
care for low-income children.
