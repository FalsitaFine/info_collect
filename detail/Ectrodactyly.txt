Ectrodactyly: The congenital absence of all or part of one or more fingers or toes.

The term ectrodactyly has been applied to a variety of malformations of the fingers or toes. It is probably best reserved for:
<ul> <li>transverse terminal aphalangia (absence of the last bone in the finger or toe), <li>adactylia (total absence of a finger or toes), or <li>acheiria (total absence of one or both hands). </li></li></li></ul>
Cases of ectrodactyly defined in this way are usually sporadic (with no family history of this malformation). As a rule, one hand is involved and the feet are not affected. Congenital constriction rings ("amniotic bands") are sometimes associated with the malformation. 
The hereditary condition called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=13614" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">split-hand/split-foot malformation</a> and sometimes called lobster-claw deformity is also termed ectrodactyly, as does another hereditary disorder called the EEC syndrome. (EEC stands for ectrodactyly, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=20848" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">ectodermal dysplasia</a>, and facial cleft.)

The word ectrodactyly is derived from the Greek ektroma (abortion) and daktylos (finger) = literally, abortion (of a) finger.
