Hair loss: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hair_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Hair loss</a> is the thinning of hair on the scalp. The medical term for hair loss is alopecia. Alopecia can be temporary or permanent. The most common form of hair loss occurs gradually and is referred to as "androgenetic alopecia," meaning that a combination of hormones (androgens are male hormones) and heredity (genetics) is needed to develop the condition. Other types of hair loss include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/alopecia_areata/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">alopecia areata</a> (patches of baldness that usually grow back), telogen effluvium (rapid shedding after childbirth, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a>, or sudden <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a>); and traction alopecia (thinning from tight braids or ponytails).
