Cider vinegar diet: The cedar vinegar diet is a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sub">weight loss</a> plan based upon the consumption of one, two, or three teaspoons of apple cider vinegar before each meal. The purported "fat burning effects" of consumption of apple cider vinegar have not been scientifically proven, and the cider vinegar diet is not considered a healthy way to lose weight. Instead, it is considered to be an example of a "fad" diet that may contribute to the cycle of weight loss and gain known as "yo-yo" dieting.
