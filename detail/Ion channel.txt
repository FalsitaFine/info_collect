Ion channel: A protein that acts as a pore in a cell membrane and permits the selective passage of ions (such as potassium ions, sodium ions, and calcium ions), by means of which electrical current passes in and out of the cell. Ion channels also serve many other critically important functions including chemical signalling, transcellular transport, regulation of pH, and regulation of cell volume. Malfunction of ion channels can cause diseases in many tissues. The array of human diseases associated with defects in ion channels is growing. These diseases are called channelopathies.
