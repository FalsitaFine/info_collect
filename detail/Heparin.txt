Heparin: An anticoagulant (anti-clotting) medication. Heparin is
useful in preventing thromboembolic complications (clots that travel from their site of
origin through the blood stream to clog up another vessel). Heparin is also used in the
early treatment of blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolisms).
