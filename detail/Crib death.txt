Crib death: The sudden and unexpected death of a baby
with no known illness, typically affecting infants from 2 weeks to 6 months of age while
sleeping. Crib death is now called Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Babies at an
increased risk for SIDS include those with a brother or sister who died of SIDS; children
whose mothers smoked or used heroin, methadone, or cocaine during pregnancy; infants born
weighing less than 4.4 pounds (2000 grams); children with an abnormal breathing pattern
with long periods without taking a breath (apnea); and babies who <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm">sleep</a> on their stomachs.
Since babies who sleep on their stomachs are at least 3 times more likely to die of SIDS
than babies who sleep on their backs, children's health authorities such as the
American Academy of Pediatrics recommend always placing infants on their backs to sleep.
