Disease, maple syrup urine: Hereditary disease due to deficiency of an enzyme involved in amino acid metabolism, characterized by urine that smells like maple syrup. The three branched-chain <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=39555" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">amino acids</a>: (leucine, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=22828" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">isoleucine</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=22837" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">valine</a>) cannot be metabolized (processed) and build up in the blood to the detriment of brain function. Untreated <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4278" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">maple syrup urine disease</a> (MSUD) causes mental retardation, physical disability and death. MSUD is a component of many <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4564" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">newborn screening</a> programs. Treatment involves a special diet and monitoring of protein intake. The special diet lacks the three branched-chain amino acids: which are then added back to provide the protein needed for normal growth and development. Close medical care is critical because even mild illnesses can become life-threatening and require hospitalization.
