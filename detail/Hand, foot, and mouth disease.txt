They are usually located on the tongue, gums, and inside of the cheeks.  The skin rash develops over 1 to 2 days with flat or raised red spots, some with blisters.  The rash does not itch, and it is usually located on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It may also appear on the buttocks.  One may have only the rash or the mouth ulcers.
