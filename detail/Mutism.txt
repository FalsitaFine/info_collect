Mutism: The inability or unwillingness to speak. 
A person who is mute cannot
or does not care to talk. Someone who was mute was said to 
be dumb, not in the sense of being stupid, but in the sense 
of being devoid of the power of speech.  The term "mutism" 
is specifically applied to people who, due to
profound congenital (or early) <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm">deafness</a>, are unable to use 
articulate language and so are affected by deaf-mutism.  
The word "mutism' comes from the Latin "mutus" meaning 
unable to speak.
