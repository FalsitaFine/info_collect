Abductor muscle: Any muscle used to pull a 
body part away from the midline of the body. For example, the 
abductor muscles of the legs spread the legs away from the midline 
and away from one another.
The word "abductor" comes from the Latin prefix "ab-" meaning "away from" + "ducere" meaning "to draw or lead" = "to draw away from."
