professional to see more of your retina, the light-sensitive layer of 
tissue at the back of your eye. 
Dilating (widening) the pupil permits your eye to be examined for 
signs of disease. To do this, drops are placed into the eye to dilate 
(widen) the pupil. After the examination, your vision may (or may 
not) remain blurred for several hours.
