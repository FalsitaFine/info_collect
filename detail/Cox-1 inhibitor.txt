Cox-1 inhibitor: An agent that inhibits the action of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3266">enzyme</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7123">cox-1</a> (cyclooxygenase-1). The common anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11510">ibuprofen</a>, and naproxen block the action of both cox-1 and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7121">cox-2</a>. Cox-1 inhibitors can reduce <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3979">inflammation</a>, but they may also decrease the natural protective <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4450">mucus</a> lining of the stomach. Therefore, these medications can cause stomach upset, intestinal bleeding, and ulcers. In some cases, using a buffered form of a cox-1 inhibitor can eliminate or reduce these adverse effects.
