Hypoplasia: Underdevelopment or incomplete development of a tissue or an organ. For example, hypoplasia of the enamel of the teeth indicates that the enamel coating is thinner than normal or missing in some but not all areas. Hypoplasia is less drastic than aplasia, where there is no development of a tissue or an organ at all.
