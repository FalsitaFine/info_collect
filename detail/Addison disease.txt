Addison disease: Long-term underfunction of the
outer portion of the adrenal gland. In medical terms, chronic insufficiency of the adrenal
cortex. This may be due to a number of different insults to the adrenal including physical
trauma, hemorrhage, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tuberculosis_tb_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tuberculosis</a> of the adrenal, and destruction of the cells in the
pituitary gland that secrete ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) which normally drives the
adrenal. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/addison_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Addison's disease</a> is characterized by bronzing of the skin, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anemia</a>,
weakness, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">low blood pressure</a>. The U.S. President J.F. Kennedy is said to have had
Addison disease. Named after the British physician Thomas Addison (1793-1860).When Addison first identified adrenal insufficiency in 1849, tuberculosis (TB) was responsible for 70-90% of cases. As the treatment for TB improved, the incidence of adrenal insufficiency due to TB of the adrenal glands greatly decreased. TB now accounts for around 20% of cases of primary adrenal insufficiency in developed countries.
