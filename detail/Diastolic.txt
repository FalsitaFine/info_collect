Diastolic: Referring to the time when the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3668">heart</a> is in a period of relaxation and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2999">dilatation</a> (expansion). 

The noun for diastolic is diastole. (The final letter in "diastole" is pronounced as a long "e" as in "lee.")
 
The diastolic pressure is specifically the minimum arterial pressure during relaxation and dilatation of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5984">ventricles</a> of the heart when the ventricles fill with blood.

In a blood pressure reading, the diastolic pressure is typically the second number recorded. For example, with a blood pressure of 120/80 ("120 over 80"), the diastolic pressure is 80. By "80" is meant 80 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury).  

A diastolic <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4463">murmur</a> is a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_murmur/article.htm">heart murmur</a> heard during diastole, the time the heart relaxes.

"Diastolic" came from the Greek <i>diastole</i> meaning "a drawing apart." The term has been in use since the 16th century to denote the period of relaxation of the heart muscle.
