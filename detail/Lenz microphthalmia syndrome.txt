Lenz microphthalmia syndrome: A genetic disorder characterized by microphthalmia (small eye) or anopthalmia (no eye) associated with malformation of the ears, teeth, fingers, skeleton, and genitourinary system. About half of patients have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/microcephaly/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">microcephaly</a> (small head) and mental retardation. The syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner with females carrying a mutation at one of two separate gene loci on the X chromosome, ANOP1 and ANOP2. Their sons, who inherit the mutation, are affected by the syndrome and rarely reproduce. The syndrome is named for Widukind Lenz (1919-1995), a German medical geneticist, who first described the syndrome in 1955. (It was Lenz who in 1961 established that the use of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/thalidomide/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">thalidomide</a> by pregnant women caused malformations and that year succeeded in having thalidomide withdrawn from the market.)
