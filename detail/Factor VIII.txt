Factor VIII: Factor eight, a key factor in the process of blood coagulation (clotting). Lack of normal factor VIII causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hemophilia/article.htm">hemophilia</a> (hemophilia A). 
The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3560">gene</a> for classic hemophilia was long known to be on the X
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=14018">chromosome</a>. Females carry the gene and transmit it to their hemophiliac sons. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3408">Female</a> carriers are normal since they have another <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6030">X chromosome</a> that contains a normal gene to make factor VIII. Each of their sons has a one-half (50:50) risk of being a hemophiliac.
Because the gene for hemophilia was clearly on the X chromosome, it was correctly inferred that the normal gene for Factor VIII was on the X. Factor VIII is also known as antihemophiliac factor or antihemophiliac globulin.
