Exstrophy: Eversion of a hollow organ at birth. An exstrophic bladder is one that is turned inside out like a rubber glove. In exstrophy of the cloaca (a primitive embryonic structure) an area of the intestine is interposed between two separate areas of the bladder. The word exstrophy is from the Greek ex, out, + strophe, a turning.
