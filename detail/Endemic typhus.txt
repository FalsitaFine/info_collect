Endemic typhus: Murine <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/typhus/article.htm">typhus</a>, an acute infectious
disease with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm">fever</a>, headache, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm">rash</a>, all quite similar to, but milder than, epidemic
typhus, caused by a related microorganism, Rickettsia typhi (mooseri), transmitted to
humans by rat fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis). The animal reservoir includes rats, mice and
other rodents. Murine typhus occurs sporadically worldwide but is more prevalent in
congested rat-infested urban areas. Also known as rat-flea typhus or urban typhus of
Malaya.
