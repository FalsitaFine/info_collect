Nerve, ninth cranial: The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7624" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">ninth cranial nerve</a> is the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7626" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">glossopharyngeal nerve</a>. All 12 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7576" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">cranial nerves</a>, the glossopharyngeal nerve included, emerge from or enter the skull (the cranium), as opposed to the spinal nerves which emerge from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11547" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">vertebral column</a>.  The glossopharyngeal nerve supplies the tongue, throat, and one of the salivary glands (the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4785" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">parotid gland</a>).  Problems with the glossopharyngeal nerve result in trouble with taste and swallowing. "Glosso-" comes from the Greek "glossa", the tongue and  "pharynx" is the Greek for throat. So the glossopharyngeal nerve is the nerve that serves the tongue and throat.
