Hypocitraturia: a low level of citrate in the urine.  A level of urine citrate of less than 320 mg/day is typically classified as low, but in severe cases, excretion of citrate can be less than 100 mg/day. Low urine citrate levels are a risk factor for kidney stone formation because citrate inhibits the process of calcium stone formation. There are a number of causes of low urine citrate and calcium kidney stone formation, including gout, urinary tract infection, certain medications, high animal protein consumption, and distal renal tubular acidosis, among others. Hypocitraturia is estimated to be involved in about 1/3 of those who have calcium kidney stones. Treatment with potassium citrate is successful at resolving the hypocitraturia in most patients.
