About 1 in every 50 (2%) people has a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4308" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Meckel's diverticulum</a>. It is usually 2 inches long and is located about 2 feet before the junction of the small bowel with the colon (the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6214" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">large intestine</a>) in the right lower abdomen.   Meckel's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3085" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">diverticulum</a> can become inflamed, ulcerate and perforate (break open or rupture). This can cause obstruction of the small bowel. Ulceration of a Meckel can cause lower intestinal bleeding.   If it is inflamed or perforated, Meckel's diverticulum is usually removed by surgery.
