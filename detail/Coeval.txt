Coeval: Of the same or equal age or duration. For example, the two elderly men were coeval with one another. Coeval usually refers to coexistence for a very long time. "Coeval" comes from the Latin "coaevus" meaning "of the same age." "Coaevus" is derived from the prefix "co-"("in or to the same degree") and "aevum" ("age" or "lifetime"). The root "ev" comes from "aevum" as in "longevity."
