Colitis, amebic:   Amebic 
dysentery (inflammation of the intestine) with ulcers in 
the colon due to infection with an ameba (Entamoeba 
histolytica), a single-celled parasite transmitted to 
humans via contaminated water and food. "Ameba" is from the 
Greek "amoibe" meaning "change" because amebae constantly 
change shape.
