Menstrual irregularity: The normal menstrual 
cycle is about four weeks long, and often follows the 
phases of the moon. Its length varies from three to seven 
days, but is usually consistent. However, girls and 
teenagers who menstruate are usually irregular. This is not 
a cause for concern unless regular menstruation has been 
established and is then lost. Some adult women also have 
irregular cycles. This can be a benign condition, but it 
can also be due to problems in the uterus or ovaries, 
including cancer. Adults with menstrual irregularity should 
see their physician to rule out disease or other problems. 
In some cases, medication can be used to regulate a 
chronically irregular cycle.
