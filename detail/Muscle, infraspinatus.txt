Muscle, infraspinatus:  A muscle that assists the lifting 
of the arm while turning the arm outward (external rotation). The 
tendon of the infraspinatus muscle is one of four tendons that 
stabilize the shoulder joint and constitute the rotator cuff. Each of 
the four tendons that makes up the rotator cuff hooks up to a muscle 
that moves the shoulder in a specific direction. The four muscles 
whose tendons form the rotator cuff are:<ul>
<li>The infraspinatus muscle; 
  
<li>The teres minor muscle, which (like the infraspinatus 
  muscle) helps in the outward turning (external rotation) of the arm; 
  
<li>The supraspinatus muscle, which is responsible for 
  elevating the arm and moving it away from the body; and 
  
<li>The subscapularis muscle, which moves the arm by turning it 
inward (internal rotation).</li></li></li></li></ul>
Damage to the rotator cuff is one of the most common causes of 
shoulder pain.
The term "infraspinatis" means below (infra) the spine. The 
infraspinatus muscle originates below the "spine" of the scapula (the 
wingbone).
