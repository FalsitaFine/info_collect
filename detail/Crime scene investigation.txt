Crime scene investigation: The use of physical evidence at the scene of the crime and the use of deductive and inductive reasoning to gain knowledge of the events surrounding the crime. Crime scene investigation is multidisciplinary and involves a systematic search of the crime scene; meticulous observation and documentation of the scene; photography and sketching of the scene; the identification, processing and collection of physical evidence such as fingerprints, footwear impressions, hair, fibers, biological fluids, and materials for DNA analysis; and. perhaps most important, the application of careful reasoning to the facts.
