The BOD POD is a computerized, egg-shaped chamber. Using the same whole-body measurement principle as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25888" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">underwater weighing</a>, the BOD POD measures a subject's mass and volume, from which their whole-body density is determined. Using these data, body fat and lean muscle mass can then be calculated.
