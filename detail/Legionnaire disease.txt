Legionnaire disease: A disease due to the   bacteria <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> found in plumbing, shower heads and   water-storage tanks. Outbreaks of Legionella <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pneumonia</a> have been   attributed to evaporative condensers and cooling towers. The   bacteria thrives in the mist sprayed from air-conditioning   ducts and so it can infest an entire building or airplane. Travelers   are especially vulnerable in the closed space within a plane.  Home hot water pipes have also been found to be a common source of the disease. The bacteria flourish at temperatures between 90 and 105 degrees and so can grow in the slimy gunk lining residential hot water pipes.  People contract the bacteria by inhaling drops of water while showering, washing or even drinking.      Legionnaire disease can cause a massive pneumonia   associated with collapse of the respiratory function. It can be an   overwhelming and sometimes fatal illness.  The disease was first identified as a sequel of the 1976   convention of the American Legion in some of the Legionnaires who had   attended the convention. It was therefore named Legionnaire   disease.
