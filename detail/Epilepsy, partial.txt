Epilepsy, partial: A seizure that affects only one 
part of the brain. Symptoms will depend on which part is 
affected: one part of the body, or multiple body parts 
confined to one side of the body, may start to twitch 
uncontrollably. Partial <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seizure/article.htm">epilepsy</a> seizures may involve head turning, 
eye movements, lip smacking, mouth movements, drooling, 
rhythmic muscle contractions in a part of the body, 
apparently purposeful movements, abnormal numbness, 
tingling, and a crawling sensation over the skin. Partial 
seizures can also include sensory disturbances, such as 
smelling or hearing things that are not there, or having a 
sudden flood of emotions. Although the patient may feel 
confused, consciousness is not lost. Also known as focal or 
local seizures.
