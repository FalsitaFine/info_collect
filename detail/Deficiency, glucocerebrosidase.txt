Deficiency, glucocerebrosidase: Causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gaucher_disease/article.htm">type 1 Gaucher disease</a>, a progressive genetic disease due to an <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3266">enzyme</a>  defect. The enzyme, glucocerebrosidase, is needed to break down the chemical glucocerebroside. 
The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3267">enzyme defect</a> leads to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10697">progressive</a> accumulation of glucocerebroside in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5531">spleen</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4179">liver</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4213">lymph nodes</a>. Gaucher disease is the most common <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3573">genetic</a> disease in Ashkenazi Jews (those of European origin) and in American and Canadian Jews. 
The most common early sign of the disease is enlargement of the spleen (located in the upper left <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2081">abdomen</a>). Other common signs include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15491">anemia</a>, a
decrease in blood <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4941">platelets</a> (clotting cells), increased pigmentation of the skin, and a yellow fatty spot on the white of the eye (called a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4908">pinguecula</a>). Severe bone 
involvement can lead to pain and collapse of the bone of the hips, shoulders, and spine. 
The gene for Gaucher disease (GD) is on <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=14018">chromosome</a> 1. The disease is a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5239">recessive</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11705">trait</a>. Both parents carry the GD <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3560">gene</a> and transmit it for their child with the disease. The risk for the parents having a child with the disease is 1 in 4 with each pregnancy. 
Type 1 Gaucher disease is known alternatively as noncerebral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4079">juvenile</a> Gaucher disease or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3607">glucocerebrosidase deficiency</a>.
