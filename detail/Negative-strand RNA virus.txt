Negative-strand RNA virus: Also known as an antisense-strand <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5382">RNA</a> virus, a virus whose genetic information consists of a single strand of RNA that is the negative or antisense strand which does not encode <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4444">mRNA</a> (messenger RNA). Examples of negative-strand RNA viruses include <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3980">influenza</a> virus, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4302">measles</a> viruses, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11943">rabies</a> virus. 
There are two types of RNA viruses. Some are positive in that they have a "sense" strand of RNA (coded information about how to build <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15380">proteins</a>) as their genetic material. And other RNA viruses tare negative in that they have an "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18223">antisense</a>" strand (the paired opposite of the coded information).  Negative-strand or antisense-strand RNA viruses are as opposed to positive-strand or sense-strand RNA viruses.
