Female organs of reproduction: The ovaries, which produce eggs (ova) and female hormones; the Fallopian tubes, which transport the egg from the ovaries to the uterus; the uterus, which receives the egg for fertilization and provides a growth environment for the developing embryo and fetus; the cervix, the lower, narrow part of the uterus that opens into the vagina; and the vagina, the muscular canal that extends from the cervix to the outside of the body and enables sperm to enter the female reproductive tract.
