Meal moth: A moth that infests both stored grain and cereal products. The moth larvae cause damage in corn meal, packaged foods, bagged grain and grain in storage. Attack is confined to surface layers of stored shelled corn and small grains. In the case of stored ear corn, however, feeding occurs anywhere, since the moths crawl among the ears to lay their eggs. Larval feeding is characterized by a webbing of the material infested. The mature larvae then often leave the material and crawl about in homes or buildings in search of a place to pupate.
