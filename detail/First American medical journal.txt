First American medical journal: The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6733" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Medical Repository</a>, founded in 1797 and published quarterly until 1824. The Medical Repository was the first serious attempt in the US to present the relation between <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=13754" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">science</a> and practice in a serial format that allowed response and communication. The Medical Repository
introduced new scientific theory, such as the chemistry of Lavoisier (in France) and Priestly (in England) as it related to medicine. It was the first publication in which physicians and laypeople alike could find the latest thoughts on subjects as diverse as "manure, meteorology, and medical practice."
