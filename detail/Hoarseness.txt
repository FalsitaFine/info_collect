Hoarseness: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hoarseness/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Hoarseness</a> is a term referring to abnormal voice changes. Hoarseness may be manifested as a voice that sounds breathy, strained, rough, raspy, or a voice that has higher or lower pitch. There are many causes of hoarseness, including viral <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/laryngitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">laryngitis</a>, vocal cord nodules, laryngeal papillomas, gastroesophageal reflux-related laryngitis, and environmental irritants (such as tobacco <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smoking</a>). An accumulation of fluid in the vocal cords associated with hoarseness has been termed Reinke's <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">edema</a>. Reinke's edema may occur as a result of cigarette smoking or voice abuse (prolonged or extended talking or shouting). Rarely, hoarseness results from serious conditions such as cancers of the head and neck region.
