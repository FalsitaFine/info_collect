Naturopathy: A system of therapy that is based on preventive care and on the use of physical forces such as heat, water, light, air, and massage as primary therapies for disease. Some naturopaths use no medications, either pharmaceutical or herbal. Some recommend herbal remedies only. A few who are licensed to prescribe may recommend pharmaceuticals in cases in which they feel their use is 'warranted.
