Bone, coccygeal: The small tail-like bone at the bottom of the spine very near to the anus. The coccyx is made up of 3-5 rudimentary vertebrae. It is the lowest part of the spinal column.
The word "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18051" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">coccygeal</a>" comes from the Greek "kokkyx" meaning "cuckoo bird." It got this name because it was thought to look like the bill of the cuckoo.
