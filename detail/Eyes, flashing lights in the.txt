Eyes, flashing lights in the:  There are a number 
of causes of spontaneous
flashing light sensations in the eye.  A sensation of 
flashing lights can be
caused when the vitreous (the clear, jelly-like substance 
that fills the
middle of the eye) shrinks and tugs on the retina. These 
flashes of light can
appear off and on for several weeks or months. With age, it 
is more common
to experience flashes. They usually do not reflect a 
serious problem.
However, if you notice the sudden appearance of light 
flashes or a sudden
increase in flashing lights, you should see your 
ophthalmologist immediately
to see if the retina has been torn or if there is another 
cause. Flashes of
light that appear as jagged lines or "heat waves" in both 
eyes, often
lasting 10-20 minutes, are different. They are usually 
caused by  migraine,
a spasm of blood vessels in the brain. Jagged lines or 
"heat waves" can also
occur without a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm">headache</a> in which case they are termed 
ophthalmic migraine,
or migraine without headache.
