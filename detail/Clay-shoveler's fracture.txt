Clay-shoveler's fracture:  An uncommon breakage of the 
spine of the vertebrae from the lower neck or upper back as a result 
of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm">stress</a>. 
Clay-shoveler's fracture usually occurs in laborers who perform 
activities involving lifting weights rapidly with the arms extended.  
Examples of these activities include shoveling soil, rubble or snow 
up and over the head backwards, using a pickax or scythe, and pulling 
out roots.
The shear force of the muscles (trapezius and rhomboid muscles) 
pulling on the spine at the base of the neck actually tears off the 
bone of the spine.
Symptoms of  clay-shoveler's fracture include burning, "knife-
like" pain at the level of the fractured spine between the upper 
shoulder blades.  The pain can sharply increase with repeated 
activity that strains the muscles of the upper back. The broken spine 
and nearby muscles are exquisitely tender.
Clay-shoveler's fracture is diagnosed by x-ray examination of the 
spine.
While the intense pain gradually subsides in days to weeks, the 
area can intermittently develop burning pain with certain activities 
that involve prolonged extending of the arms (like computer work).
Most patients require no treatment.  Pain medications, physical 
therapy, and massage can be of help.  Occasionally, surgical removal 
of the tip of the broken spine is performed for those with 
longstanding pain.
