Cancer, stomach: Cancer of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5560">stomach</a>, the main organ that holds food for digestion. Worldwide, stomach cancer is the second most frequent cancer and the second leading cause of death from cancer. It can develop in any part of the stomach and spread to other organs. It is also known as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.comhttps://www.medicinenet.com/endoscopy/article.htm7">gastric</a> cancer.  

<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3131">Duodenal ulcers</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4829">peptic ulcers</a>) are not associated with stomach cancer. However, infection with a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2416">bacterium</a> called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3676">Helicobacter pylori</a> is associated with gastric cancer. In one study, gastric cancer developed in about 3% of the infected patients and none of the uninfected patients. Eradication of the bacterium prevents or delays the development of gastric cancer. The risk of gastric cancer is also increased in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3112">Down syndrome</a>.

Symptoms of stomach cancer are often vague, such as loss of appetite and weight, so diagnosis is often delayed. The cancer is diagnosed definitively with a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2466">biopsy</a> of stomach <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5800">tissue</a>.
