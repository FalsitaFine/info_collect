one commonly feels before <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sleep/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sleep</a>, the transitional state preceding sleep, and also the hallucinations that may occur at that time.
The original French word "hypnagogique" was derived from Greek roots "hypno-", sleep + "agogos", leading = leading to sleep. In the 19th century "hypnagogique" came across the English Channel and became "hypnagogic." A closely allied term is "hypnoidal." It means
resembling hypnosis and also refers to the subwaking state, the condition intermediate between sleeping and waking.
