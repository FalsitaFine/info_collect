Cryptitis: A term that is used to describe one of the abnormalities that is seen under the microscope when small intestinal or colonic tissue is examined. The intestinal crypts are tubular structures composed of cells that protrude from the inner lining of the intestines and into the walls of the intestines. These crypts contain the cells that give rise to all the other cells that move out of the crypts and eventually line the inner lining of the intestines. Inflammation of the crypts is known as cryptitis. Cryptitis is
seen in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/inflammatory_bowel_disease_intestinal_problems/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inflammatory bowel disease</a>,
both Crohn's   and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ulcerative_colitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Ulcerative Colitis</a>, but it also can be seen in other inflammatory conditions of the intestines. It is not a disease itself  but a histologic manifestation of several different
diseases.
