Lymph node, sentinel: The first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a>. The sentinel node for a given tumor is found by injecting a tracer substance around the tumor. This substance then travels through the lymphatic system to the sentinel node. The tracer substance may be a blue dye that can be tracked visually or a radioactive colloid that can be followed radiologically. Biopsy of the sentinel lymph node can reveal whether <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> has spread through the lymphatic system. If the sentinel node contains tumor cells, removal of more nodes in the area may be warranted.
