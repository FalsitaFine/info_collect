Banding of chromosomes: Treatment staining of chromosomes to reveal characteristic patterns of horizontal bands. Thanks to these banding patterns, which resemble bar codes, each human chromosome is distinctive and can be identified without ambiguity. Banding also permits the detection of chromosome deletions (lost segments), duplications (extra segments), and other structural abnormalities.
