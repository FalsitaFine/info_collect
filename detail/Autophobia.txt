Sufferers from autophobia may experience <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a> even though they realize that being alone does not threaten their well-being. They may worry about being ignored and unloved, or they may worry about intruders, strange noises or the possibility of developing a medical problem.
Autophobia also has another sense, that of an irrational fear of oneself, intense self-fear that is groundless.   The word "autophobia" is derived from two Greek words: "autos" (self) and "phobos" (fear) = literally, self-fear, fear of oneself. "Autos" has given us many English words such as "automatic" and "automotive" (self-moving) and "autonomy" (self-governing). And "phobos" has bequeathed us a vast number of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/phobias/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">phobias</a> such as "claustrophobia" (fear of closed places) and "acrophobia" (fear of heights).
