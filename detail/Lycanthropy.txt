Lycanthropy: The delusion that one has become a wolf or the werewolf transformation. Werewolf myths were associated with the phases of the moon. The werewolf was thought to take over when the moon was full.
 The word "lycanthropy" is from the Greek "lykos," meaning "wolf" + "anthropos" meaning "human being."
