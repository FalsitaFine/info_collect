Blood sugar, high: An elevated level of the sugar <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3608">glucose</a> in the blood. Also called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperglycemia/article.htm">hyperglycemia</a>.
High blood sugar is a finding in a number of conditions, most notably <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm">diabetes mellitus</a>. Elevated blood glucose leads to spillage of glucose into the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5915">urine</a> (glucosuria) so that the urine is sugary. (The term <i>diabetes mellitus</i> means "sweet urine.") 

Aside from diabetes, the many other causes of high blood sugar include just eating more sugar (or food) than usual, the presence of an infection or another illness, an injury and the stress of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5603">surgery</a>.

High blood sugar may produce few or no symptoms. When there are symptoms, they may be dry mouth, thirst, frequent urination, urination during the night, blurry vision, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9879">fatigue</a> or drowsiness, weight loss, or increased appetite.
 
An elevated level of blood sugar may be a useful independent indicator of heart disease risk. The risk of dying from heart disease has been found to rise as the level of blood glucose increases (regardless of age, weight, blood pressure, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2710">cholesterol</a> and smoking status).
