Artery: A vessel that carries blood high in  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10690">oxygen</a> content away from the heart to the farthest reaches of the body. Since blood in arteries is usually full of oxygen, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15738">hemoglobin</a> in the red blood cells is oxygenated. The resultant form of hemoglobin (oxyhemoglobin) is what makes arterial blood look bright red. 
Arteries are part of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3197">efferent</a> wing of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2738">circulatory system</a>. 
("Efferent" from the Latin "ex", out + "ferre", to bear = to bear out 
or carry away. What the arteries are carrying away is blood from the heart.)
By contrast, a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5970">vein</a> is a blood vessel that carries blood low in 
oxygen content from the body back to the heart. The deoxygenated form 
of hemoglobin (deoxyhemoglobin) in venous blood makes it appear 
dark. Veins are part of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2167">afferent</a> wing of the circulatory system 
which returns blood to the heart.
