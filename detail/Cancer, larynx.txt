Also called laryngeal cancer or laryngeal carcinoma.  Cancer of the larynx occurs most often in people over the age of 55 years. A clear association has been made between <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/smoking_and_quitting_smoking/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">smoking</a>, excess alcohol ingestion, and laryngeal cancer. If a patient with laryngeal cancer continues to smoke and drink alcoholic beverages, the likelihood of a cure is diminished, and the risk of developing a second <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> is enhanced. People who stop smoking and drinking can greatly reduce their risk of cancer of the larynx.
