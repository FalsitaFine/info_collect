Barrett esophagus: A complication of chronic severe gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD) that involves a change in the type of cells that line the inner wall of the lower esophagus. There is a small but definite increased risk of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cancer</a> of the esophagus (adenocarcinoma) in people with Barrett esophagus. The diagnosis of Barrett esophagus is made on seeing (through <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/endoscopy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">endoscopy</a>) a pink esophageal lining (mucosa) that extends a short distance (usually less than 2.5 inches) up the esophagus from the gastroesophageal junction and finding cell changes on biopsy of the lining. Treatment involves acid-suppression drugs and followup monitoring of the esophagus is advised.
