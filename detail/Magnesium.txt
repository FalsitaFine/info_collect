Magnesium: A mineral involved in many processes in the
body including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4537">nerve</a> signaling, the building of healthy bones, and normal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4464">muscle</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2834">contraction</a>. About 350 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15392">enzymes</a> are known to depend on magnesium. 
Magnesium is contained in all unprocessed foods. High concentrations of magnesium are contained in nuts, unmilled grains, dark-green leafy vegetables, legumes such as peas and beans, and fruit. Magnesium is thus readily available in foods that form the basis of a healthful diet. 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4244">Magnesium deficiency</a> can occur due to inadequate intake of magnesium, impaired intestinal <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2101">absorption</a> of the mineral, or excessive loss of it. Large amounts of magnesium can be lost by prolonged exercise, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6202">lactation</a>, excessive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9299">sweating</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2728">chronic</a> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2985">diarrhea</a>; the use of drugs such as diuretics, digitalis, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25441">cisplatin</a> and cyclosporine; and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4103">kidney</a> disease, an overactive <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=19509">thyroid</a> or parathyroid, low blood levels of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9970">potassium</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3857">hypokalemia</a>) and high urine levels of calcium (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3834">hypercalcemia</a>). Magnesium deficiency is often associated with low blood levels of calcium (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3855">hypocalcemia</a>) and potassium (hypokalemia). Deficiency of magnesium causes increased irritability of the nervous system with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=13312">tetany</a> (spasms of the hands and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3405">feet</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4468">muscular</a> twitching and cramps, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11248">spasm</a> of the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6224">larynx</a>, etc.).
According to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18440">National Academy of Sciences</a>, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=22382">Recommended Dietary Allowance</a> (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11603">RDA</a>) of magnesium is 420 milligrams per day for men and 320 milligrams per day for women. The upper limit of magnesium as supplements is 350 milligrams daily, in addition to
the magnesium from <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11363">food</a> and water. Persons with impaired kidney function should be especially careful about their magnesium intake because they can accumulate magnesium, a dangerous situation.
Drinking water is a significant source of magnesium if the water supply is hard -- rich in minerals. (Water supplies in much of the US are hard but in the Southeast they are soft.) Soft water is deficient in minerals, including magnesium. Water for drinking should therefore not be softened.
