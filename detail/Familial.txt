Familial: A condition that tends to occur more often in family members than is expected by chance alone. A familial disease may be genetic (such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cystic_fibrosis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">cystic fibrosis</a>) or environmental (such as chicken pox).
