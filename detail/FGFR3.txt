FGFR3: Abbreviation for fibroblast growth factor <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5236">receptor</a> 3. Mutations in the FGFR3 <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3560">gene</a> are known to cause three different syndromes -- <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9068">hypochondroplasia</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2115">achondroplasia</a>, and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9728">thanatophoric dysplasia</a>. These syndromes represent variations in severity. Hypochondroplasia is the mildest and thanatophoric <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3142">dysplasia</a> (also called thanatophoric <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3136">dwarfism</a>) is the most severe. In fact, thanatophoric dysplasia is a type of dwarfism in which death usually occurs in the first hours of life. FGF3 is an example of how different syndromes can result from mutations in a single gene.
