Ear canal, self-cleaning: Most of the time the ear
canals are self-cleaning, that is, there is a slow and orderly migration of ear canal skin
from the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3177" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">eardrum</a> to the outer opening. Old earwax is constantly being transported from the
deeper areas of the ear canal to the opening where it usually dries, flakes, and falls
out.
