Epidermis: The upper or outer layer of the two main
layers of cells that make up the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7901">skin</a>. The epidermis is mostly made 
up of flat, scale-like cells called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5540">squamous cells</a>. Under the 
squamous cells are round cells called basal cells. The deepest part 
of the epidermis also contains melanocytes. These cells produce 
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.comhttps://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis/article.htm0">melanin</a>, which gives the skin its color.
