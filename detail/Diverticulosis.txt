<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diverticulosis/article.htm">Diverticulosis</a>: Diverticulosis is the 
condition of having diverticula, small outpouchings from 
the large intestine, the colon. (One outpouching is a diverticulum; 
two or more are 
diverticula).
Diverticulosis can occur anywhere in the colon but it is most 
typical in the sigmoid colon, the S-shaped segment of the colon 
located in the left lower part of the abdomen. (Sides are from the 
patient's perspective so the left lower part of your abdomen is 
nearest your left hand).
