Blood culture: A test designed to detect if microorganisms such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=13954">bacteria</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=24858">fungi</a> are present in 
blood. A sample of blood obtained using sterile technique is placed in a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2879">culture</a> media and 
incubated in a controlled environment for 1 to 7 days. If microorganisms grow, 
they can be identified as to type and tested against different antibiotics for 
proper treatment of the infection. Because microorganisms may only be intermittently present in blood, a series of 3 blood cultures is usually done before the result is considered negative.
