Nosebleed, causes of: The nose is a part of the body  that is very rich in blood vessels (vascular) and is situated in a vulnerable position on the face. As a result, any trauma to the face can cause bleeding which may be profuse.  Nosebleeds can occur spontaneously when the nasal membranes dry out, crust, and crack, as  is common in dry climates, or during the winter months when the air is dry and warm from  household heaters. People are more susceptible if they are taking medications which  prevent normal blood clotting (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">warfarin</a> or other "blood thinner", aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  medication, or antiplatelet medications such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clopidogrel/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">clopidogrel</a>). Other predisposing factors include infection, trauma, allergic and  non-allergic rhinitis, hypertension., alcohol abuse and inherited bleeding problems.
