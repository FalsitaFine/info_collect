Cystine:  An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2222">amino acid</a> that is particularly notable because it is the least soluble of all of the naturally occurring amino acids and because it precipitates out of solution in the genetic disease  <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8475">cystinuria</a> to form stones in the urinary tract. Cystine is the chief sulfur-containing compound in protein. Cystine is generated by the union of two <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=22823">cysteine</a> molecules and so is sometimes called dicysteine. It is abbreviated Cys-Cys. See also: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8475">Cystinuria</a>.
