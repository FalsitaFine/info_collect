FLAP: A gene that helps make a leukotriene, a signal that activates the white blood cells involved in inflammation. FLAP stands for 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein.  FLAP has been implicated in a number of inflammatory responses, including <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">asthma</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">arthritis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/psoriasis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">psoriasis</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">heart attack</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">stroke</a>.  FLAP was the first gene discovered to be a major risk factor for the common form of heart attack and the second major genetic factor identified in the common form of stroke.   Also known, confusingly, as
 5-lipoxygenase activating protein, five-lipoxygenase-activating protein, five-lipoxygenase activating protein,  arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein,
arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase activating protein, and ALOX5AP.
