Barotitis: Middle ear problems due to changing atmospheric pressures,
as when a plane descends to land. The problems include ear pain, ringing, diminished
hearing and, sometimes, dizziness. The word barotitis (pronounced bar-o-tit-is) is
compounded from bar- as in barometer + otitis meaning inflammation of the ear. Alternate
terms include aerotitis, aerotitis media, barotitis media, and otic barotrauma.
