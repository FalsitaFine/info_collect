Gonad, indifferent: A gonad in an embryo that has not differentiated into a definitive testis or ovary. An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8981" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">indifferent gonad</a> becomes a testis if the embryo has a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6049" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Y chromosome</a>, but if the embryo has no Y chromosome, the indifferent gonad becomes an ovary. The absence of a Y chromosome permits the indifferent gonad to become an ovary, but both X chromosomes are needed for the ovary to function normally.
