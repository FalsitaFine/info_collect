Macular vision: The macula is a special area in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye. As we read, light is focused onto our macula. There, millions of cells change the light into nerve signals that tell the brain what we are seeing. This is called our macular or central vision. 
Thanks to central vision, we are able to read, drive, and perform other activities that require fine, sharp, straight-ahead vision.
