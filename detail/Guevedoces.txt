Guevedoces: individuals reported to apparently change gender naturally at <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/puberty/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">puberty</a>, from female to male. These people have been observed in an isolated village in the Dominican Republic and in the eastern highlands of Papua New Guinea. Infants with female appearance at birth begin to develop physical characteristics of a male during puberty. These individuals have been referred to by different names in their own regions, including guevedoces, translated to mean "penis at age twelve," and machihembras, which means "first a woman, then a man." In Papua New Guinea, the locals called these individuals turnims, meaning "expected to become men."
