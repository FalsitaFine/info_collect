Crick-Brenner experiment: An elegant and important experiment performed in 1961 by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32828" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">Francis Crick</a> and Sydney Brenner. The experiment proved that the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3574" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">genetic code</a> was a triplet code and that the triplets were not separted by "punctuation." Crick and Brenner demonstrated that a triplet of bases in the DNA determines an amino acid unit and a string of triplets thereby specifies the full sequence of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=39555" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dict">amino acids</a> in a protein. The Crick-Brenner experiment consisted of deleting bases, one by one, in the DNA and showing that only after three bases had been eliminated in close proximity did the DNA-transcribing system come back into correct phase.
