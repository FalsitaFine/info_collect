B cell: A type of white blood cell and, 
specifically, a type of lymphocyte. 

Many B cells mature into what are called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4935">plasma cells</a> that produce antibodies (proteins) necessary to fight off infections while other B cells mature into <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11644">memory B cells</a>. 
All of the plasma cells descended from a single B cell produce the same antibody which is 
directed against the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2282">antigen</a> that stimulated it to mature. The same 
principle holds with memory B cells. Thus, all of the plasma cells 
and memory cells "remember" the stimulus that led to their formation.
