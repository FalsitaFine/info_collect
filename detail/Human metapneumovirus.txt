Human metapneumovirus: A novel virus that is a ubiquitous and important agent of respiratory disease. The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was discovered in 2001 in young children in The Netherlands with acute respiratory illnesses ranging from mild upper respiratory infections to severe bronchiolitis and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pneumonia</a>. It has since been found to cause severe acute respiratory infections all over the world in young children, the elderly, and people with weak defense systems (the immunocompromised). It accounts for 1 to 3% of all <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">flu</a>-like illnesses. (The influenza viruses, which belong to the orthomyxovirus family, cause most cases of flu and flu-like illnesses.)
