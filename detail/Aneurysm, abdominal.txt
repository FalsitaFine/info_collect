Aneurysm, abdominal: An aneurysm 
situated within the abdomen (belly).  An aneurysm is a  
localized widening (dilatation) of an artery, vein, or the 
heart.  At the area of an aneurysm, there is typically a 
bulge and the wall is weakened and may rupture. The word 
"aneurysm" comes from the Greek "aneurysma" meaning "a 
widening." See: Aneurysm, aortic.
