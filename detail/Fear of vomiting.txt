Fear of vomiting: An abnormal and persistent fear of vomiting. Sufferers of this fear experience undue <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">anxiety</a> even though they realize their fear is irrational. They usually are especially worried about vomiting in public and embarrassing themselves. Consequently, they often avoid office meetings, banquets, dances and other social gatherings. The anxiety produced by this phobia can cause stomach "butterflies" and nausea. Fear of vomiting is termed "emetophobia," a word derived from the Greek word "emetos" (vomiting) and "phobos" (fear). Related English words include "emesis" (vomiting), "emetic" (that which induces vomiting, such as the syrup of ipecac used to bring up poisons) and "emetology" (the study of vomiting).
