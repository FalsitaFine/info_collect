Cyclin E: A protein that is part of a molecular network that controls the cell cycle. There are a large number of cyclin proteins involved in this endeavor. Cyclin E specifically regulates the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle. A high level of cyclin E accelerates the transition of the cell through the G1 phase.
Cyclin E is of prognostic value in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_cancer_facts_stages/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breast cancer</a>. High levels of cyclin E in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tumor_grade/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">tumor</a> correlate with a poor outcome, whereas low levels correlate with a good outcome.
