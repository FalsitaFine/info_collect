Antisense: In molecular biology, the strand complementary to a coding sequence of a nucleic acid. 
<u>Antisense DNA</u> is the non-coding strand complementary to the coding strand in double-stranded DNA. The antisense strand serves as the template for messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis. 
<u>Antisense RNA</u> is the non-coding strand complementary to a coding sequence of mRNA, a molecule involved in translating genetic instructions into proteins. Antisense RNA hybridizes with and inactivates mRNA. 
<u>Antisense drugs</u> are based on the fact that antisense RNA hybridizes with and inactivates mRNA. These drugs are short sequences of RNA that attach to mRNA and stop a particular gene from producing the protein for which it holds the recipe. Antisense drugs are being developed to treat <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/lung_cancer/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">lung cancer</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diabetes</a> and diseases such as <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">arthritis</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">asthma</a> with a major inflammatory component.
