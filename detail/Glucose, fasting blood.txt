much glucose (sugar)
there
is in a blood sample taken after an overnight fast. The 
fasting blood
glucose
test is commonly used in the detection of diabetes 
mellitus. A blood sample
is
taken in a lab, doctor's office, or hospital. The test is 
done in the
morning
before the person has eaten. The normal, nondiabetic range 
for blood
glucose
is from 70 to 110 mg/dl, depending on the type of blood 
being tested. If
the
level is over 140 mg/dl, it usually means the person has 
diabetes (except
for
newborns and some pregnant women).
