Emotional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/child_abuse_facts/article.htm">child abuse</a>: Emotional <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/child_abuse_facts/article.htm">child abuse</a> is the third 
most frequently reported form of child abuse (after child neglect and 
physical child abuse), accounting 17% of all cases of child abuse. 
It is likely that emotional child abuse is greatly underreported, 
since it can be difficult to detect and difficult to document.  
Emotional child abuse includes acts of commission or omission by 
the parents and other caregivers that could cause the child to have 
serious behavioral, emotional, or mental disorders. In some instances 
of emotional child abuse, the acts of parents or other caregivers 
alone, without any harm yet evident in the child's behavior or 
condition, are sufficient to warrant the intervention of child 
protective services. For example, the parents/caregivers may use 
extreme or bizarre forms of punishment, such as confinement of a 
child in a dark closet.
Emotional child abuse is also sometimes termed psychological child 
abuse, verbal child abuse, or mental injury of a child.
