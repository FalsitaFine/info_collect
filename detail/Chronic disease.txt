Chronic disease: A disease that persists for a long time. A chronic
disease is one lasting 3 months or more, by the definition of the U.S. National
Center for Health Statistics. Chronic diseases generally cannot be prevented by
vaccines or cured by medication, nor do they just disappear. Eighty-eight
percent of Americans over 65 years of age have at least one chronic health
condition (as of 1998). Health damaging behaviors - particularly tobacco use,
lack of physical activity, and poor eating habits - are major contributors to
the leading chronic diseases.
