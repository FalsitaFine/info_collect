Linkage map: A map of the genes on a chromosome based on linkage
analysis. A linkage map does not show the physical distances between genes but rather
their relative positions, as determined by how often two gene loci are inherited together.
The closer two genes are (the more tightly they are linked), the more often they will be
inherited together. Linkage distance is measured in centimorgans (cM).
