Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome: A 
syndrome of unknown origin that mainly affects young children. It 
causes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm">fever</a>, reddening of the eyes (conjunctivitis) and lips and 
mucous 
membranes of the mouth, ulcerative <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gum_disease/article.htm">gum disease</a> (gingivitis), swollen 
glands in the neck (cervical lymphadenopathy), and a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm">rash</a> that is 
raised and bright red (maculoerythematous) in a glove-and-sock 
fashion over the hands and feet. The skin there becomes hard, swollen 
(edematous), and peels. The name "mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome" 
is descriptive because the disease is characterized by the typical 
changes in the mucus membranes that line the lips and mouth and by 
the enlarged and tender lymph glands. Also called Kawasaki's  
syndrome, the mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome was first described 
in the late 1960's in Japan by the pediatrician Tomisaku 
Kawaski.
