Black Death: The Medieval <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/plague_facts/article.htm">black plague</a> that ravaged Europe and killed a third of its population. It was due to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4927">plague</a> which is  caused by a bacterium (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6058">Yersinia pestis</a>) transmitted to humans from infected rats by the oriental rat flea. 

In 14<sup>th</sup>-century
Europe, the victims of the Black Death had bleeding below the skin
(subcutaneous <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=14263">hemorrhage</a>) which darkened ("blackened") their bodies. The Black Death was characterized by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gangrene/article.htm">gangrene</a> of the fingers, toes, and nose.

Although some scientists have speculated that the Black Death was caused by other agents (including anthrax, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/typhus/article.htm">typhus</a>, and Ebola virus), DNA tests on 600-year-old teeth from victims of the Black Death have confirmed that Yersinia pestis was indeed the cause of the Black Death.
