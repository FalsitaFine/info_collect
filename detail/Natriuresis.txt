Natriuresis: The excretion of an excessively large amount of sodium in the urine. Natriuresis is similar to diuresis (the excretion of an unusually large quantity of urine), except that in natriuresis the urine is exceptionally salty. Natriuresis occurs with some diuretics and diseases (as of the adrenal) and can lead to the salt-losing syndrome characterized by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dehydration/article.htm">dehydration</a>, vomiting, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_blood_pressure/article.htm">low blood pressure</a>, and the risk of sudden death.
Natriuresis is a ancient language hybrid of the Latin natrium = sodium and the Greek ouresis = a making water.
