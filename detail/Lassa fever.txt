Lassa fever: An acute viral infection found in the tropics, especially in West Africa. Lassa <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">fever</a> is caused by a single-stranded RNA virus that is animal borne (zoonotic). Lassa fever can cause a potentially fatal illness, is highly contagious, and can rapidly spread. The reservoir, or host, of the Lassa virus is a rodent known as the 'multimammate rat.' People can become infected by eating this infected rat or by eating food contaminated by the rat's excretions. Person-to-person transmission also occurs via direct contact, contamination of skin breaks with infected blood, and aerosol spreads (virus particles moving through the air). The first symptoms typically occur 1 to 3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus and may include high fever, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sore throat</a>, cough, eye inflammation (conjunctivitis), facial swelling, pain behind the breastbone, back pain, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">abdominal pain</a>, vomiting, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">diarrhea</a>, and general weakness that lasts for several days.
