<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm">Breast</a>: The breast refers to the front of the chest 
or, more specifically, to the mammary gland.  The mammary gland is a 
milk producing gland.  It is composed largely of fat. Within the 
mammary gland is a complex network of branching ducts.  These ducts 
exit from sac-like structures called lobules, which can produce milk 
in females.  The ducts exit the breast at the nipple.
The breast has been viewed as an organ designed to produce milk. 
The lobules are the glands that produce the breast milk. The ducts 
are tubes or channels which transport the milk from these glands out 
to the nipple. The nipple becomes erect because of cold, breast 
feeding and sexual activity. The pigmented area around the nipple is 
called the areola.  
The lobules and ducts are supported in the breast by surrounding 
fatty tissue and ligaments. There are no muscles in the breast. 
There are blood vessels and lymphatics in the breast. The 
lymphatics are thin channels similar to blood vessels; they do not 
carry blood but collect and carry tissue fluid which ultimately 
reenters the blood stream. Breast tissue fluid drains through the 
lymphatics into the lymph nodes located in the underarm (axilla) and 
behind the breast bone (sternum).
