The surgeon removes only part of the larynx (voice box)'just one vocal cord, just part of a vocal cord, or just the epiglottis'and the opening in the front of the neck (stoma) is temporary. After a brief recovery period, the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/tracheostomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">tracheostomy</a> tube is removed, and the stoma closes up. The patient can then breathe and talk in the usual way. In some cases, however, the voice may be hoarse or weak.
