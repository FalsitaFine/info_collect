Locomotion: Movement from one place to 
another. And the ability to locomote, to get from one place to the 
next. The locomotive system permits locomotion and consists of bones 
that are the framework of the skeleton, joints that hold the bones 
together and make movement possible, and muscles that contract and 
relax and make for movement. Locomotion is derived from the Latin 
"locus", place + "movere", move = move place.
