Lordosis: Inward curvature of the spine. The spine is not supposed to be absolutely straight, so some degree of curvature is normal. When the curve exceeds the usual range, it may be due to musculoskeletal disease or simply to poor posture. Treatment usually involves physical therapy, although in severe cases surgery, casting, and/or bracing may be required. The neck and low back normally have some lordosis.
