Bronchitis, chronic: Inflammation and swelling of the lining of the airways, leading to narrowing and obstruction generally resulting in daily cough.

Obstruction of the airways, especially with mucus, increases the likelihood of bacterial lung infection. <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_bronchitis/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">Chronic bronchitis</a> is common in persons who have smoked for extended periods.
