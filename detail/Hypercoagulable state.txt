Hypercoagulable state: A hypercoagulable state is the 
medical term for a condition in which there is an abnormally 
increased tendency toward blood clotting (coagulation).  

There are numerous hypercoagulable states.  Each has different causes 
and each increases a person's chances of developing blood clots such 
as those associated with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/phlebitis_and_thrombophlebitis/article.htm">thrombophlebitis</a> (clot in the veins).

Causes of hypercoagulable states include medications (female 
hormones, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/conjugated_equine_estrogens_and_medroxyprogesteron/article.htm">estrogens</a> and <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm">birth control</a> pills), after surgery (post-
operative period, especially hip, knee, and urinary system 
procedures), pregnancy, phospholipid antibodies in blood 
(anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant), cancer (though 
most patients with a hypercoagulable state do not have cancer), 
elevated blood homocysteine levels, and inherited protein 
deficiencies (antithrombin III, factor V Leiden, protein S, protein 
C, and others).
