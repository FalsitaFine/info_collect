Aromatase: An enzyme involved in the production of estrogen that acts by catalyzing the conversion of testosterone (an androgen) to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/estradiol/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">estradiol</a> (an estrogen). Aromatase is located in estrogen-producing cells in the adrenal glands, ovaries, placenta, testicles, adipose (fat) tissue, and brain.
The growth of some <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">breast</a> cancers is promoted by <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/estrogens_conjugated-vaginal_cream/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">estrogens</a>. For example, the drug <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/letrozole/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="pharm">letrozole</a> (brand name: Femara) is an antiestrogen sometimes used to treat such estrogen-dependent tumors. The drug acts by inhibiting the enzyme aromatase which lowers the level of the estrogen, estradiol.
