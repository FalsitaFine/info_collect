Dyspraxia, developmental: A pattern of delayed, 
uneven, or aberrant development of physical abilities during childhood development. The physical abilities affected may be gross or fine motor skills. Developmental dyspraxia may be seen 
alone or in combination with other developmental problems, 
particularly apraxia or dyspraxia of speech. Treatment is 
via early intervention, using physical therapy to improve 
gross motor skills and occupational therapy to assist in 
fine motor development and sensory integration.
