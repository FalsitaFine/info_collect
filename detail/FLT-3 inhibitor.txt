FLT-3 inhibitor: A gene-targeted therapy for a common subtype of acute myeloid <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/leukemia/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">leukemia</a> (AML) known as FLT-positive AML in which there is a FLT3 receptor mutation. The FLT-3 inhibitor is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that interferes with abnormal FLT3 function by preventing essential proteins from binding to the DNA. The FLT-3 inhibitor blocks the action of the altered FLT-3 gene, rendering it powerless. Sorafenib and others are in <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/clinical_trials/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="proc">clinical trials</a> as FLT-3 inhibitors for AML.
