Appendectomy: Removal by surgery of the appendix, 
the small worm-like appendage of the colon (the large bowel). An 
appendectomy is performed because of probable <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/appendicitis/article.htm">appendicitis</a>, 
inflammation of the wall of the appendix generally associated with 
infection.
Appendicitis usually is suspected because of the medical history 
and physical examination. The pain of developing appendicitis is at 
first diffuse and poorly localized (not confined to one spot) but, as 
the inflammation extends through the appendix to its outer covering 
and then to the lining of the abdomen, the pain changes and becomes 
localized to one small area between the front of the right hip bone 
and the belly button. The exact point is named after Dr. Charles 
McBurney - McBurney's point.  If the appendix ruptures and infection 
spreads throughout the abdomen, the pain becomes diffuse again as the 
entire lining of the abdomen becomes inflamed. Ultrasonography and 
computerized tomography also may be helpful in diagnosis. 
Due to the varying size and location of the appendix and the 
proximity of other organs to the appendix, it may be difficult to 
differentiate appendicitis from other intra-abdominal diseases.
The treatment for appendicitis is antibiotics and 
surgical removal of the appendix (appendectomy). Complications of 
appendectomy include wound infection, abscess, and obstruction of the 
intestine.
The first successful appendectomy was done in Davenport, Iowa in 
1885 by Dr. William West Grant. The patient was Mary Gartside, age 
22.
