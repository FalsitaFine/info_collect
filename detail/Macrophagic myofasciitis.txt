Macrophagic myofasciitis: A muscle disease first identified in 1993,
macrophagic myofasciitis is named for the findings seen in tissue from
muscle biopsies, namely an abnormal infiltrate surrounding muscle tissue of
specialized immune cells called "macrophages," a type of immune cell important
to swallowing and destroying microorganisms. They also assist other immune
cells in the body's response to invading organisms.
