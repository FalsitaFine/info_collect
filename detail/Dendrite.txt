Dendrite: A short arm-like protuberance from a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4537">nerve</a> cell (a <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7785">neuron</a>). Dendrites from neurons next to one another are tipped by synapses (tiny transmitters and receivers for 
chemical messages between the cells).
The word "dendrite" means "branched like a tree." It comes from the Greek "dendron" (tree).
