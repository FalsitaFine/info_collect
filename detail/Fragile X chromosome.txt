Fragile X chromosome: An <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6030">X chromosome</a> with a heritable fragile 
site associated with a frequent form of mental retardation -- the fragile X syndrome.

The fragile X chromosome was first sighted by Dr. Herbert A. Lubs in 1969 who termed it the "marker X.". The fragile X is also called FRAXA. It was the first <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3515">fragile site</a> found on the X chromosome. 

The fragile X chromosome is due to a trinucleotide repeat sequence (a recurring motif of 3 bases) in the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3090">DNA</a> at that spot.
