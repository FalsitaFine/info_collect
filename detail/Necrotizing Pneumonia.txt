Necrotizing pneumonia: This is a rare complication of bacterial <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">pneumonia</a> (lung infection by bacteria) in which tissue death (necrosis) begins to occur in the lung. 
<i>Necrosis</i> is the word for cellular or tissue death due to lack of oxygen. 
In necrotizing <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_quiz/quiz.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="quiz">pneumonia</a>, there is a reduction in the vascular supply to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lungs_picture/picture.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="img">lungs</a>, leading to areas of cellular death. The lack of blood supply due to damaged blood vessels impairs the delivery of antibiotics to the infection, allowing for further progression of the infection.
