Gouty arthritis: An attack that is usually extremely
painful of joint inflammation due to deposits of uric acid crystals 
in the joint fluid (synovial fluid) and joint lining (synovial lining). Intense joint inflammation occurs as white blood cells engulf the uric acid crystals, causing pain, heat, and redness of the
joint tissues. The term "<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/gout_gouty_arthritis/article.htm">gout</a>" commonly is used to refer to these painful <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm"> arthritis</a> attacks but gouty arthritis is only one manifestation of gout.
