Hailey-Hailey disease: This genetic (<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">inherited</a>) skin condition causes a painful <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">rash</a> with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/blisters/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">blister</a> formation in skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, neck, under the breasts, and between the buttocks. The signs and symptoms tend to worsen with <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/sunburn_and_sun_poisoning/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">sunburn</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperhidrosis_sweating_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="slide">sweating</a>, and friction (such as tight clothing) in the affected areas. A mutation in a gene known as ATP2C1 causes the condition, and people inherit the condition in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that when one parent has a copy of the mutant gene, the children have a 50% chance of developing the condition.
