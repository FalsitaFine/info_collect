Hysterosalpingogram (HSG): A hysterosalpingogram imaging test that is used to examine the cavity of the uterus and Fallopian tubes. In a hysterosalpingogram, dye (called contrast material) is injected through a tube inserted through the vaginal into the uterus. A series of x-ray pictures are taken as the dye moves through the uterine cavity and out through the Fallopian tubes. If the Fallopian tubes are normal, the dye will flow out through the tubes into the abdominal cavity, and is then naturally absorbed by the body. The test takes about 15-30 minutes and is performed by a radiologist or gynecologist, typically in the radiology department of the hospital.
