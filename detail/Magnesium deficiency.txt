Magnesium deficiency: Can occur due to inadequate
intake or impaired intestinal absorption of magnesium. Low magnesium (hypomagnesemia) is
often associated with low calcium (hypocalcemia) and low potassium (hypokalemia).
Deficiency of magnesium causes increased irritability of the nervous system with tetany
(spasms of the hands and feet, muscular twitching and cramps, spasm of the larynx, etc.).
According to the National Academy of Sciences, the Recommended Dietary Allowances of
magnesium are 420 milligrams per day for men and 320 milligrams per day for women. The
upper limit of magnesium as supplements is 350 milligrams daily, in addition to the
magnesium from food and water.
