GB virus C: A virus first identified in 1995 that is genetically related to the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_c/article.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="dt">hepatitis C</a> virus but which does not cause hepatitis and, in fact, is not known to be responsible for any disease. 
Infection with GB virus C (GBV-C) is beneficial to HIV-infected patients. They enjoy longer survival if they are coinfected with this virus and HIV than if they have HIV alone. Having two viruses is better than one here. Having both HIV and GB virus C is better than having HIV alone.

GB virus C (GBV-C) is also called hepatitis G. However, the designation GB virus C (GBV-C) is preferred because the virus is not a cause of hepatitis.
